11.05.2019 | 1h   | Wrote the basis for the design document and planned the features of the program | 

## Week 2

Date       | time | what-I-did |
-----------|------|--------|
13.05.2019 | 5h | I read and learned the fundamentals of Huffman code, and begun to implement the program |
14.05.2019 | 5h | Implementing the elements of Huffman code in Java, max and min heap as priorityqueue |
15.05.2019 | 5h | ...continued to work on Huffman code, read and researched on its elements |
16.05.2019 | 4h | Managed to make the code extract shortened binary, made the comparison to original... |
17.05.2019 | 3h | ...found out that the binary output of the algo is incorrect, tried fixing the problem without any progress |

## Week 3

Date       | time | what-I-did |
-----------|------|--------|
20.05.2019 | 4h | Fixed the code so that Huffman-coding is done correctly |
21.05.2019 | 5h | Looking up ways on how to read files into a suitable form of input for the program |
22.05.2019 | 5h | Trying to solve the input as byte-array design, no success |
23.05.2019 | 2h | Tidying the code, writing tests |
24.05.2019 | 1h | Enabled jacoco and ensured that the tests are reasonable |


## Week 4

Date       | time | what-I-did |
-----------|------|--------|
28.05.2019 | 1h | Looked up some relevant info regarding bit-operations |
29.05.2019 | 5h | Trying to get the Byte input working |
30.05.2019 | 5h | Refactoring the program to transform input to Byte arrays |
31.05.2019 | 6h | Writing the ArrayList as a placeholder, trying to solve the Byte-mess.   Started writing testing document and implementation document |

## Week 5

Date       | time | what-I-did |
-----------|------|--------|
3.06.2019 | 5h | Getting the program to write bytes correctly |
5.06.2019 | 6h | Managed to get small input "compressed" and decompressed using only bytes |
6.06.2019 | 5h | Trying to solve a bug which messes the symbols with a large input (Moby Dick) |
7.06.2019 | 4h | Reading Cormen and learning the basics of PriorityQueue, also ArrayList |

## Week 6

Date       | time | what-I-did |
-----------|------|--------|
14.06.2019 | 1h | Tidying the code and removing unused partions of the code. Set some tests to show that parts of the code are functional |

## Week 7

Date       | time | what-I-did |
-----------|------|--------|
17.06.2019 | 5h | Debugging the compression-output |
18.06.2019 | 6h | Changing the huffman-codebits from byte to string for easier management |
19.06.2019 | 6h | Trying to get decoding work with the compressed file |
20.06.2019 | 6h | Final shot at trying to get the actual commpression to work, no success |
21.06.20019| 8h | Tried very hard to implement Min-Heap, got thrown against the wall by it. |
