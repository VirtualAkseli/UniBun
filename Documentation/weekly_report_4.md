# Week 4
[Breakdown of used hours](https://github.com/VirtualAkseli/UniBun/blob/master/Documentation/usedhours.md "hours used")

## Progress
- Converting the files to Bytes and back-again is working. 
- ArrayList has been "copied" from here: [ArrayList](http://java2novice.com/java-interview-programs/arraylist-implementation/ "ArrayList")
. As the internet only seemed to offer ready made code, I decided to put this as it is and make it more my own later on.

## Problems
- There are flaws in the correct decoding of files back to the original
form.
- The compression is not working, because I have not measured the right size for the output-file.

## Questions
- NIL

## Upcoming progress

- Arithmetic coding
- Working compressed files
