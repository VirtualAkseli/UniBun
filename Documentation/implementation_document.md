# Implementation document

## Summary
UniBun is still work-in-progress. It *can not* be run from anywhere except from the netbeans IDE.

No analysis for time- & space-complexity has been done.

The current flaws and needs for improvement are:
- Getting the compression to work
- Outputting (decoding) the compressed file
- Implementing arithmetic coding
- A GUI for ease of use and visually illustrating test-results.
