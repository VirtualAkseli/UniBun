# Week 3
[Breakdown of used hours](https://github.com/VirtualAkseli/UniBun/blob/master/Documentation/usedhours.md "hours used")

## Progress
- Through trial and error, files were read and handled with the Huffman-algorithm. 
However, I have not been able to compress data, as the output has been larger than the original output.

## Problems
- Bit-manipulation is difficult to me, yet interesting.

## Questions
- Looking forward to the demo date so that I can get this engine running on full steam.
- If I encounter enourmous problems understanding and implementing 
the bit-manipulations needed in actually compressing the files, is it possible(, as a "back-door"/"emergency-exit",)
to just implement Huffman-coding and Arithmetic coding properly and then compare mere Strings within the program? 
Would I be able to fill the requirements for this lab? 

## Upcoming progress

- I need to start implementing the data-structures.
- ...and Arithmetic coding
