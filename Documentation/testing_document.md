# Testing document

## Current situation
So far, the testing has been implemented to ensure the key features are working. Some tests are disabled, as recent changes to
the handling of the input have made other parts of the program non-working.


## Future development
The aim of testing regarding this project is to achieve such a state, in which the user can see as ready-crunched numbers the
efficiency of used algorithms and how much time was spent etc.

Jacoco is used to easily check and ensure that the testing reaches every nook and cranny of the program.
