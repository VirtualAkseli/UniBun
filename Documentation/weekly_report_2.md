# Week 2
[Breakdown of used hours](https://github.com/VirtualAkseli/UniBun/blob/master/Documentation/usedhours.md "hours used")

## Progress
- I managed to get the basic Huffman tree set, as is proved by the test-output of my code :
`dnghEsfwm-corialevyTt. : 0.9999999999999999. Lapset: vasen: evyTt. : 0.42056074766355134 , oikea: dnghEsfwm-corial: 0.5794392523364486 `
and so on...

## Problems
- The actual encoding of the symbols is not working at the moment. The problem is that there is one extra '0' bit ahead of
every huffman binary.
- I have not started testing and javadoc needs more attention.
- The code is messy and many methods need to be shortened/divided.


## Questions
- Is it so, that in a class/package that deals with handling I/O, (e.g. turning a picture into a string) it is O.K.
to use String ?


## Upcoming progress
- I intend to be able to compress pictures by the third deadline. Also, the implementation of data structures will have started by then
