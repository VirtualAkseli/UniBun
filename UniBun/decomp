sall me bshmaelb oome years agoIInever mind how long preciselyIIhaving
little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
shore, b thought b would sail about a little and see the watery part of
the worldb bt is a way b have of driving off the spleen and regulating
the circulationb uhenever b find myself growing grim about the mouth 
whenever it is a damp, driccly sovember in my soul  whenever b find
myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up
the rear of every funeral b meet  and especially whenever my hypos get
such an upper hand of me, that it rebuires a strong moral principle to
prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically
knocking people s hats offIIthen, b account it high time to get to sea
as soon as b canb Ihis is my substitute for pistol and ballb uith a
philosophical flourish sato throws himself upon his sword  b buietly

it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very
nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with meb

Ihere now is your insular city of the  anhattoes, belted round by
wharves as bndian isles by coral reefsIIcommerce surrounds it with
her surfb  ight and left, the streets take you waterwardb bts estreme

cooled by breeces, which a few hours previous were out of sight of landb

do you seenII
osted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand
thousands upon thousands of mortal men fised in ocean reveriesb oome
leaning against the spiles  some seated upon the pierIheads  some
looking over the bulwarks of ships from shina  some high aloft in the
rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peepb  ut these
are all landsmen  of week days pent up in lath and plasterIItied to
counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desksb  ow then is thisn rre

 ut looks here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
seemingly bound for a diveb otranges sothing will content them but the
estremest limit of the land  loitering under the shady lee of yonder
warehouses will not sufficeb sob Ihey must get eust as nigh the water
as they possibly can without falling inb rnd there they standIImiles of
themIIleaguesb bnlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets
and avenuesIInorth, east, south, and westb eet here they all uniteb
Iell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all
those ships attract them thithern

almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a
dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the streamb Ihere is magic
in itb ret the most absentIminded of men be plunged in his deepest
reveriesIIstand that man on his legs, set his feet aIgoing, and he will
infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that regionb
ohould you ever be athirst in the great rmerican desert, try this
esperiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical
professorb ees, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for
everb

 ut here is an artistb  e desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,
buietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of
the oacob uhat is the chief element he employsn Ihere stand his trees,
each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifis were within  and
here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle  and up from yonder
cottage goes a sleepy smokeb reep into distant woodlands winds a
macy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their
hillIside blueb  ut though the picture lies thus tranced, and though
this pineItree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd s
head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd s eye were fised upon the
magic stream before himb  o visit the 
rairies in iune, when for scores
on scores of miles you wade kneeIdeep among IigerIliliesIIwhat is the
one charm wantingnIIuaterIIthere is not a drop of water theres uere
siagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to
see itn uhy did the poor poet of Iennessee, upon suddenly receiving two
handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly
needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to  ockaway  eachn uhy
is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at
some time or other cracy to go to sean uhy upon your first voyage as a
passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first
told that you and your ship were now out of sight of landn uhy did the
old 
ersians hold the sea holyn uhy did the  reeks give it a separate
deity, and own brother of ioven ourely all this is not without meaningb
rnd still deeper the meaning of that story of sarcissus, who because
he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain,
plunged into it and was drownedb  ut that same image, we ourselves see
in all rivers and oceansb bt is the image of the ungraspable phantom of
life  and this is the key to it allb

sow, when b say that b am in the habit of going to sea whenever b begin
to grow hacy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs,
b do not mean to have it inferred that b ever go to sea as a passengerb
ror to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is
but a rag unless you have something in itb  esides, passengers get
seaIsickIIgrow buarrelsomeIIdon t sleep of nightsIIdo not eneoy
themselves much, as a general thing IIno, b never go as a passenger 
nor, though b am something of a salt, do b ever go to sea as a
sommodore, or a saptain, or a sookb b abandon the glory and distinction
of such offices to those who like themb ror my part, b abominate all
honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind
whatsoeverb bt is buite as much as b can do to take care of myself,
without taking care of ships, barbues, brigs, schooners, and what notb
rnd as for going as cook,IIthough b confess there is considerable glory
in that, a cook being a sort of officer on shipIboardIIyet, somehow,
b never fancied broiling fowls IIthough once broiled, eudiciously
buttered, and eudgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who
will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled
fowl than b willb bt is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old
sgyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the
mummies of those creatures in their huge bakeIhouses the pyramidsb

so, when b go to sea, b go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,
plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mastIheadb
Irue, they rather order me about some, and make me eump from spar to
spar, like a grasshopper in a  ay meadowb rnd at first, this sort
of thing is unpleasant enoughb bt touches one s sense of honour,
particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the
ian  ensselaers, or  andolphs, or  ardicanutesb rnd more than all,
if eust previous to putting your hand into the tarIpot, you have been
lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand
in awe of youb Ihe transition is a keen one, b assure you, from a
schoolmaster to a sailor, and rebuires a strong decoction of oeneca and
the otoics to enable you to grin and bear itb  ut even this wears off in
timeb

uhat of it, if some old hunks of a seaIcaptain orders me to get a broom
and sweep down the decksn uhat does that indignity amount to, weighed,
b mean, in the scales of the sew Iestamentn ro you think the archangel
 abriel thinks anything the less of me, because b promptly and
respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instancen uho ain t
a slaven Iell me thatb uell, then, however the old seaIcaptains may
order me aboutIIhowever they may thump and punch me about, b have the
satisfaction of knowing that it is all right  that everybody else is
one way or other served in much the same wayIIeither in a physical
or metaphysical point of view, that is  and so the universal thump is
passed round, and all hands should rub each other s shoulderIblades, and
be contentb

rgain, b always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of
paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single
penny that b ever heard ofb en the contrary, passengers themselves must
payb rnd there is all the difference in the world between paying
and being paidb Ihe act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable
infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon usb  ut  sbs 

rbr,IIwhat will compare with itn Ihe urbane activity with which a man
receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly
believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account
can a monied man enter heavenb rhs how cheerfully we consign ourselves
to perditions

rinally, b always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome
esercise and pure air of the foreIcastle deckb ror as in this world,
head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern ithat is,
if you never violate the 
ythagorean masimi, so for the most part the
sommodore on the buarterIdeck gets his atmosphere at second hand from
the sailors on the forecastleb  e thinks he breathes it first  but not
sob bn much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many
other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect itb
 ut wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a
merchant sailor, b should now take it into my head to go on a whaling
voyage  this the invisible police officer of the rates, who has the
constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me
in some unaccountable wayIIhe can better answer than any one elseb rnd,
doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand
programme of 
rovidence that was drawn up a long time agob bt came in as
a sort of brief interlude and solo between more estensive performancesb
b take it that this part of the bill must have run something like thisI

Ihough b cannot tell why it was esactly that those stage managers, the
rates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others
were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and
easy parts in genteel comedies, and eolly parts in farcesIIthough
b cannot tell why this was esactly  yet, now that b recall all the
circumstances, b think b can see a little into the springs and motives
which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced
me to set about performing the part b did, besides caeoling me into the
delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill
and discriminating eudgmentb

shief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great
whale himselfb ouch a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my
curiosityb Ihen the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island
bulk  the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale  these, with all
the attending marvels of a thousand 
atagonian sights and sounds, helped
to sway me to my wishb uith other men, perhaps, such things would not
have been inducements  but as for me, b am tormented with an everlasting
itch for things remoteb b love to sail forbidden seas, and land on
barbarous coastsb sot ignoring what is good, b am buick to perceive a
horror, and could still be social with itIIwould they let meIIsince it
is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place
one lodges inb

 y reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome  the
great floodIgates of the wonderIworld swung open, and in the wild
conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into
my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them
all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the airb

b stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpetIbag, tucked it under my arm,
and started for sape  orn and the 
acificb euitting the good city of
old  anhatto, b duly arrived in sew  edfordb bt was a oaturday night in
recemberb  uch was b disappointed upon learning that the little packet
for santucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that place
would offer, till the following  ondayb

rs most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at
this same sew  edford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well
be related that b, for one, had no idea of so doingb ror my mind was
made up to sail in no other than a santucket craft, because there was a
fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous
old island, which amacingly pleased meb  esides though sew  edford has
of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though
in this matter poor old santucket is now much behind her, yet santucket
was her great originalIIthe Iyre of this sarthage IIthe place where the
first dead rmerican whale was strandedb uhere else but from santucket
did those aboriginal whalemen, the  edI en, first sally out in canoes to
give chase to the reviathann rnd where but from santucket, too, did that
first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported
cobblestonesIIso goes the storyIIto throw at the whales, in order to
discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowspritn

sow having a night, a day, and still another night following before me
in sew  edford, ere b could embark for my destined port, it became a
matter of concernment where b was to eat and sleep meanwhileb bt was a
very dubiousIlooking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold
and cheerlessb b knew no one in the placeb uith ansious grapnels b had
sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,IIoo,
wherever you go, bshmael, said b to myself, as b stood in the middle of
a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the
north with the darkness towards the southIIwherever in your wisdom you
may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear bshmael, be sure to inbuire
the price, and don t be too particularb

uith halting steps b paced the streets, and passed the sign of  Ihe
srossed  arpoons IIbut it looked too espensive and eolly thereb rurther
on, from the bright red windows of the  owordIrish bnn,  there came such
fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from
before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches
thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,IIrather weary for me, when b struck
my foot against the flinty proeections, because from hard, remorseless
service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plightb Ioo
espensive and eolly, again thought b, pausing one moment to watch the
broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses
withinb  ut go on, bshmael, said b at last  don t you hearn get away
from before the door  your patched boots are stopping the wayb oo on b
wentb b now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for
there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest innsb

ouch dreary streetss blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,
and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tombb rt
this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that buarter of
the town proved all but desertedb  ut presently b came to a smoky light
proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly
openb bt had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the
public  so, entering, the first thing b did was to stumble over an
ashIbos in the porchb  as thought b, ha, as the flying particles almost
choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,  omorrahn  ut  Ihe
srossed  arpoons,  and  Ihe owordIrishn IIthis, then must needs be the
sign of  Ihe Irapb   owever, b picked myself up and hearing a loud voice
within, pushed on and opened a second, interior doorb

bt seemed the great  lack 
arliament sitting in Iophetb r hundred black
faces turned round in their rows to peer  and beyond, a black rngel
of room was beating a book in a pulpitb bt was a negro church  and the
preacher s test was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and
wailing and teethIgnashing thereb  a, bshmael, muttered b, backing out,
uretched entertainment at the sign of  Ihe Iraps 

 oving on, b at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks,
and heard a forlorn creaking in the air  and looking up, saw a swinging
sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing
a tall straight eet of misty spray, and these words underneathII Ihe

bb  ut it is a common name in santucket, they say, and b suppose this

the place, for the time, looked buiet enough, and the dilapidated little
wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from
the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a
povertyIstricken sort of creak to it, b thought that here was the very
spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffeeb

bt was a bueer sort of placeIIa gableIended old house, one side palsied

mighty pleasant cephyr to any one inIdoors, with his feet on the hob

it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or whether

reasonest wellb ees, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is

Is   b Ihe opouterIbnnb


sntering that gableIended opouterIbnn, you found yourself in a wide,
low, straggling entry with oldIfashioned wainscots, reminding one of
the bulwarks of some condemned old craftb en one side hung a very large
oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the
unebual crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent
study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inbuiry of
the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its
purposeb ouch unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first
you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the sew
sngland hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitchedb  ut by dint
of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and
especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the
entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however
wild, might not be altogether unwarrantedb

 ut what most puccled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,
black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three
blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeastb r boggy,
soggy, sbuitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distractedb
eet was there a sort of indefinite, halfIattained, unimaginable
sublimity about it that fairly froce you to it, till you involuntarily
took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting
meantb sver and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you
throughbIIbt s the  lack oea in a midnight galebIIbt s the unnatural
combat of the four primal elementsbIIbt s a blasted heathbIIbt s a
 yperborean winter scenebIIbt s the breakingIup of the icebound stream
of Iimeb  ut at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous
something in the picture s midstb I rI once found out, and all the rest
were plainb  ut stop  does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic
fishn even the great leviathan himselfn

bn fact, the artist s design seemed thisI a final theory of my own,
partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom
b conversed upon the subeectb Ihe picture represents a sapeI orner in a
great hurricane  the halfIfoundered ship weltering there with its three
dismantled masts alone visible  and an esasperated whale, purposing to
spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself
upon the three mastIheadsb

Ihe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish
array of monstrous clubs and spearsb oome were thickly set with
glittering teeth resembling ivory saws  others were tufted with knots of
human hair  and one was sickleIshaped, with a vast handle sweeping round
like the segment made in the newImown grass by a longIarmed mowerb eou
shuddered as you gaced, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage
could ever have gone a deathIharvesting with such a hacking, horrifying
implementb  ised with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons
all broken and deformedb oome were storied weaponsb uith this once long
lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did sathan owain kill fifteen
whales between a sunrise and a sunsetb rnd that harpoonIIso like a
corkscrew nowIIwas flung in iavan seas, and run away with by a whale,
years afterwards slain off the sape of  lancob Ihe original iron entered
nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle soeourning in the body of a
man, travelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the
humpb

srossing this dusky entry, and on through yon lowIarched wayIIcut
through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with
fireplaces all roundIIyou enter the public roomb r still duskier place
is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled
planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft s
cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this cornerIanchored
old ark rocked so furiouslyb en one side stood a long, low, shelfIlike
table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities
gathered from this wide world s remotest nooksb 
roeecting from the
further angle of the room stands a darkIlooking denIIthe barIIa rude
attempt at a right whale s headb  e that how it may, there stands the
vast arched bone of the whale s eaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive
beneath itb uithin are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters,
bottles, flasks  and in those eaws of swift destruction, like another
cursed ionah iby which name indeed they called himi, bustles a little
withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors
deliriums and deathb

rbominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poisonb Ihough

I bo mark, and your charge is but a penny  to I bo a penny more  and so
on to the full glassIIthe sape  orn measure, which you may gulp down for
a shillingb

bpon entering the place b found a number of young seamen gathered about
a table, esamining by a dim light divers specimens of on b o rsrs b b
sought the landlord, and telling him b desired to be accommodated with a
room, received for answer that his house was fullIInot a bed unoccupiedb
  ut avast,  he added, tapping his forehead,  you haint no obeections
to sharing a harpooneer s blanket, have yen b s pose you are goin 
aIwhalin , so you d better get used to that sort of thingb 

b told him that b never liked to sleep two in a bed  that if b should
ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and
that if he ithe landlordi really had no other place for me, and the
harpooneer was not decidedly obeectionable, why rather than wander
further about a strange town on so bitter a night, b would put up with
the half of any decent man s blanketb

 b thought sob rll right  take a seatb ouppernIIyou want suppern
oupper ll be ready directlyb 

b sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the
 atteryb rt one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with
his eackIknife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space
between his legsb  e was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but
he didn t make much headway, b thoughtb

rt last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an
adeoining roomb bt was cold as bcelandIIno fire at allIIthe landlord
said he couldn t afford itb sothing but two dismal tallow candles, each
in a winding sheetb ue were fain to button up our monkey eackets, and
hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frocen fingersb  ut
the fare was of the most substantial kindIInot only meat and potatoes,
but dumplings  good heavenss dumplings for suppers ene young fellow in
a green bos coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful
mannerb

  y boy,  said the landlord,  you ll have the nightmare to a dead
sartaintyb 

 randlord,  b whispered,  that aint the harpooneer is itn 

 eh, no,  said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny,  the harpooneer
is a dark complesioned chapb  e never eats dumplings, he don tIIhe eats
nothing but steaks, and he likes  em rareb 

 Ihe devil he does,  says bb  uhere is that harpooneern bs he heren 

  e ll be here afore long,  was the answerb

b could not help it, but b began to feel suspicious of this  dark
complesioned  harpooneerb rt any rate, b made up my mind that if it so
turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into
bed before b didb

oupper over, the company went back to the barIroom, when, knowing not
what else to do with myself, b resolved to spend the rest of the evening
as a looker onb


resently a rioting noise was heard withoutb otarting up, the landlord
cried,  Ihat s the  rampus s crewb b seed her reported in the offing
this morning  a three years  voyage, and a full shipb  urrah, boys  now
we ll have the latest news from the reegeesb 

r tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry  the door was flung open,
and in rolled a wild set of mariners enoughb snveloped in their shaggy
watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all
bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an
eruption of bears from rabradorb Ihey had eust landed from their boat,
and this was the first house they enteredb so wonder, then, that they
made a straight wake for the whale s mouthIIthe barIIwhen the wrinkled
little old ionah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all
roundb ene complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which ionah
mised him a pitchIlike potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a
sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how
long standing, or whether caught off the coast of rabrador, or on the
weather side of an iceIislandb

Ihe libuor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even
with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering
about most obstreperouslyb

b observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though
he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own
sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise
as the restb Ihis man interested me at once  and since the seaIgods
had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate ithough but a
sleepingIpartner one, so far as this narrative is concernedi, b will
here venture upon a little description of himb  e stood full sis feet
in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a cofferIdamb b have
seldom seen such brawn in a manb  is face was deeply brown and burnt,
making his white teeth daccling by the contrast  while in the deep
shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give
him much eoyb  is voice at once announced that he was a ooutherner,
and from his fine stature, b thought he must be one of those tall
mountaineers from the rlleghanian  idge in iirginiab uhen the revelry
of his companions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away
unobserved, and b saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the
seab bn a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and
being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised
a cry of   ulkingtons  ulkingtons where s  ulkingtonn  and darted out of
the house in pursuit of himb

bt was now about nine o clock, and the room seeming almost
supernaturally buiet after these orgies, b began to congratulate myself
upon a little plan that had occurred to me eust previous to the entrance
of the seamenb

so man prefers to sleep two in a bedb bn fact, you would a good deal
rather not sleep with your own brotherb b don t know how it is, but
people like to be private when they are sleepingb rnd when it comes to
sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange
town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your obeections indefinitely
multiplyb sor was there any earthly reason why b as a sailor should
sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else  for sailors no more sleep
two in a bed at sea, than bachelor nings do ashoreb Io be sure they
all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and
cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skinb

Ihe more b pondered over this harpooneer, the more b abominated the
thought of sleeping with himb bt was fair to presume that being a
harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of
the tidiest, certainly none of the finestb b began to twitch all overb
 esides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be
home and going bedwardsb ouppose now, he should tumble in upon me at
midnightIIhow could b tell from what vile hole he had been comingn

 randlords b ve changed my mind about that harpooneerbIIb shan t sleep
with himb b ll try the bench hereb 

 iust as you please  b m sorry b can t spare ye a tablecloth for a
mattress, and it s a plaguy rough board here IIfeeling of the knots and
notchesb   ut wait a bit, okrimshander  b ve got a carpenter s plane
there in the barIIwait, b say, and b ll make ye snug enoughb  oo saying
he procured the plane  and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting
the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning
like an apeb Ihe shavings flew right and left  till at last the
planeIiron came bump against an indestructible knotb Ihe landlord was
near spraining his wrist, and b told him for heaven s sake to buitIIthe
bed was soft enough to suit me, and b did not know how all the planing
in the world could make eider down of a pine plankb oo gathering up the
shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in
the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a
brown studyb

b now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too
short  but that could be mended with a chairb  ut it was a foot too
narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher
than the planed oneIIso there was no yoking themb b then placed the
first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,
leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down inb  ut b
soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under
the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially
as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window,
and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate
vicinity of the spot where b had thought to spend the nightb

Ihe devil fetch that harpooneer, thought b, but stop, couldn t b steal
a march on himIIbolt his door inside, and eump into his bed, not to be
wakened by the most violent knockingsn bt seemed no bad idea  but upon
second thoughts b dismissed itb ror who could tell but what the nest
morning, so soon as b popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be
standing in the entry, all ready to knock me downs

otill, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending
a sufferable night unless in some other person s bed, b began to think
that after all b might be cherishing unwarrantable preeudices against
this unknown harpooneerb Ihinks b, b ll wait awhile  he must be dropping
in before longb b ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may
become eolly good bedfellows after allIIthere s no tellingb

 ut though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,
and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneerb

 randlords  said b,  what sort of a chap is heIIdoes he always keep such
late hoursn  bt was now hard upon twelve o clockb

Ihe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to
be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehensionb  so,  he
answered,  generally he s an early birdIIairley to bed and airley to
riseIIyes, he s the bird what catches the wormb  ut toInight he went out
a peddling, you see, and b don t see what on airth keeps him so late,
unless, may be, he can t sell his headb 

 san t sell his headnIIuhat sort of a bamboocingly story is this you
are telling men  getting into a towering rageb  ro you pretend to say,
landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed oaturday
night, or rather ounday morning, in peddling his head around this townn 

 Ihat s precisely it,  said the landlord,  and b told him he couldn t
sell it here, the market s overstockedb 

 uith whatn  shouted bb

 uith heads to be sure  ain t there too many heads in the worldn 

 b tell you what it is, landlord,  said b buite calmly,  you d better
stop spinning that yarn to meIIb m not greenb 

  ay be not,  taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick,  but b
rayther guess you ll be done   eus if that ere harpooneer hears you a
slanderin  his headb 

 b ll break it for him,  said b, now flying into a passion again at this
unaccountable farrago of the landlord sb

 bt s broke a ready,  said heb

  roke,  said bII   ens, do you meann 

 oartain, and that s the very reason he can t sell it, b guessb 

 randlord,  said b, going up to him as cool as  tb  ecla in a
snowIstormII landlord, stop whittlingb eou and b must understand one
another, and that too without delayb b come to your house and want a
bed  you tell me you can only give me half a one  that the other half
belongs to a certain harpooneerb rnd about this harpooneer, whom b
have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and
esasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling
towards the man whom you design for my bedfellowIIa sort of connesion,
landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest
degreeb b now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this
harpooneer is, and whether b shall be in all respects safe to spend the
night with himb rnd in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay
that story about selling his head, which if true b take to be good
evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and b ve no idea of sleeping
with a madman  and you, sir, eeb b mean, landlord, eeb, sir, by trying
to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to
a criminal prosecutionb 

 uall,  said the landlord, fetching a long breath,  that s a purty long
sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and thenb  ut be easy, be easy,
this here harpooneer b have been tellin  you of has eust arrived from
the south seas, where he bought up a lot of  balmed sew iealand heads
igreat curios, you knowi, and he s sold all on  em but one, and that one
he s trying to sell toInight, cause toImorrow s ounday, and it would not
do to be sellin  human heads about the streets when folks is goin  to
churchesb  e wanted to, last ounday, but b stopped him eust as he was
goin  out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the
airth like a string of inionsb 

Ihis account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed
that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling meIIbut at
the same time what could b think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a
oaturday night clean into the holy oabbath, engaged in such a cannibal
business as selling the heads of dead idolatorsn

 repend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous manb 

  e pays reg lar,  was the reeoinderb   ut come, it s getting dreadful
late, you had better be turning flukesIIit s a nice bed  oal and me
slept in that ere bed the night we were splicedb Ihere s plenty of room
for two to kick about in that bed  it s an almighty big bed thatb uhy,
afore we give it up, oal used to put our oam and little iohnny in the
foot of itb  ut b got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and
somehow, oam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his armb
rrter that, oal said it wouldn t dob some along here, b ll give ye a
glim in a eiffy   and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards
me, offering to lead the wayb  ut b stood irresolute  when looking at a
clock in the corner, he esclaimed  b vum it s oundayIIyou won t see that
harpooneer toInight  he s come to anchor somewhereIIcome along then  re
come  ues I ye comen 

b considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and b was
ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,
with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers
to sleep abreastb

 Ihere,  said the landlord, placing the candle on a cracy old sea chest
that did double duty as a washIstand and centre table   there, make
yourself comfortable now, and good night to yeb  b turned round from
eyeing the bed, but he had disappearedb

rolding back the counterpane, b stooped over the bedb Ihough none of the
most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably wellb b then glanced
round the room  and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see
no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four
walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whaleb ef
things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed
up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner  also a large seaman s bag,
containing the harpooneer s wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunkb
rikewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf
over the fireIplace, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bedb

 ut what is this on the chestn b took it up, and held it close to the
light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive
at some satisfactory conclusion concerning itb b can compare it to
nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little
tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine buills round an
bndian moccasinb Ihere was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat,
as you see the same in oouth rmerican ponchosb  ut could it be possible
that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the
streets of any shristian town in that sort of guisen b put it on, to try
it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and
thick, and b thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer
had been wearing it of a rainy dayb b went up in it to a bit of glass
stuck against the wall, and b never saw such a sight in my lifeb b tore
myself out of it in such a hurry that b gave myself a kink in the neckb

b sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this
headIpeddling harpooneer, and his door matb rfter thinking some time on
the bedIside, b got up and took off my monkey eacket, and then stood in
the middle of the room thinkingb b then took off my coat, and thought
a little more in my shirt sleevesb  ut beginning to feel very cold now,
half undressed as b was, and remembering what the landlord said about
the harpooneer s not coming home at all that night, it being so very
late, b made no more ado, but eumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and
then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the
care of heavenb

uhether that mattress was stuffed with cornIcobs or broken crockery,
there is no telling, but b rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep
for a long timeb rt last b slid off into a light doce, and had pretty
nearly made a good offing towards the land of sod, when b heard a heavy
footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room
from under the doorb

rord save me, thinks b, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal
headIpeddlerb  ut b lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word
till spoken tob  olding a light in one hand, and that identical sew
iealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without
looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the
floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords
of the large bag b before spoke of as being in the roomb b was all
eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while
employed in unlacing the bag s mouthb Ihis accomplished, however, he
turned roundIIwhen, good heavenss what a sights ouch a faces bt was of
a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large
blackish looking sbuaresb ees, it s eust as b thought, he s a terrible
bedfellow  he s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is,
eust from the surgeonb  ut at that moment he chanced to turn his face
so towards the light, that b plainly saw they could not be
stickingIplasters at all, those black sbuares on his cheeksb Ihey were
stains of some sort or otherb rt first b knew not what to make of this 
but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to meb b remembered a story of
a white manIIa whaleman tooIIwho, falling among the cannibals, had been
tattooed by themb b concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his
distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventureb rnd what is it,
thought b, after alls bt s only his outside  a man can be honest in any
sort of skinb  ut then, what to make of his unearthly complesion, that
part of it, b mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the
sbuares of tattooingb Io be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of
tropical tanning  but b never heard of a hot sun s tanning a white man
into a purplish yellow oneb  owever, b had never been in the oouth oeas 
and perhaps the sun there produced these estraordinary effects upon the
skinb sow, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning,
this harpooneer never noticed me at allb  ut, after some difficulty
having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled
out a sort of tomahawk, and a sealIskin wallet with the hair onb 
lacing
these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the sew
iealand headIIa ghastly thing enoughIIand crammed it down into the bagb
 e now took off his hatIIa new beaver hatIIwhen b came nigh singing out
with fresh surpriseb Ihere was no hair on his headIInone to speak of at
leastIInothing but a small scalpIknot twisted up on his foreheadb  is
bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skullb
 ad not the stranger stood between me and the door, b would have bolted
out of it buicker than ever b bolted a dinnerb

sven as it was, b thought something of slipping out of the window, but
it was the second floor backb b am no coward, but what to make of
this headIpeddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehensionb
bgnorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and
confounded about the stranger, b confess b was now as much afraid of him
as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at
the dead of nightb bn fact, b was so afraid of him that b was not
game enough eust then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer
concerning what seemed inesplicable in himb

 eanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed
his chest and armsb rs b live, these covered parts of him were checkered
with the same sbuares as his face  his back, too, was all over the same
dark sbuares  he seemed to have been in a Ihirty eears  uar, and eust
escaped from it with a stickingIplaster shirtb otill more, his very
legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up
the trunks of young palmsb bt was now buite plain that he must be some
abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the oouth
oeas, and so landed in this shristian countryb b buaked to think of itb
r peddler of heads tooIIperhaps the heads of his own brothersb  e might
take a fancy to mineIIheavenss look at that tomahawks

 ut there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about
something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that
he must indeed be a heathenb  oing to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or
dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the
pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with
a hunch on its back, and esactly the colour of a three days  old songo
babyb  emembering the embalmed head, at first b almost thought that
this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar mannerb  ut
seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal
like polished ebony, b concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden
idol, which indeed it proved to beb ror now the savage goes up to the
empty fireIplace, and removing the papered fireIboard, sets up this
little hunchIbacked image, like a tenpin, between the andironsb Ihe
chimney eambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that b
thought this fireIplace made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel
for his songo idolb

b now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but
ill at ease meantimeIIto see what was nest to followb rirst he takes
about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places
them carefully before the idol  then laying a bit of ship biscuit on
top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into
a sacrificial blaceb 
resently, after many hasty snatches into the fire,
and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers iwhereby he seemed to be
scorching them badlyi, he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit 
then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of
it to the little negrob  ut the little devil did not seem to fancy such
dry sort of fare at all  he never moved his lipsb rll these strange
antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the
devotee, who seemed to be praying in a singIsong or else singing some
pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the
most unnatural mannerb rt last estinguishing the fire, he took the idol
up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as
carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcockb

rll these bueer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and
seeing him now eshibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business
operations, and eumping into bed with me, b thought it was high time,
now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which
b had so long been boundb

 ut the interval b spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal oneb
Iaking up his tomahawk from the table, he esamined the head of it for an
instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle,
he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smokeb Ihe nest moment the light
was estinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth,
sprang into bed with meb b sang out, b could not help it now  and giving
a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling meb

otammering out something, b knew not what, b rolled away from him
against the wall, and then coneured him, whoever or whatever he might
be, to keep buiet, and let me get up and light the lamp againb  ut his
guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my
meaningb

 uhoIe debel youn IIhe at last saidII you no speakIe, damIme, b killIeb 
rnd so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the
darkb

 randlord, for  od s sake, 
eter soffins  shouted bb  randlords uatchs
soffins rngelss save mes 

 opeakIes tellIee me whoIee be, or damIme, b killIes  again growled the
cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the
hot tobacco ashes about me till b thought my linen would get on fireb
 ut thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light
in hand, and leaping from the bed b ran up to himb

 ron t be afraid now,  said he, grinning again,  eueebueg here wouldn t
harm a hair of your headb 

 otop your grinning,  shouted b,  and why didn t you tell me that that
infernal harpooneer was a cannibaln 

 b thought ye know d it IIdidn t b tell ye, he was a peddlin  heads
around townnIIbut turn flukes again and go to sleepb eueebueg, look
hereIIyou sabbee me, b sabbeeIIyou this man sleepe youIIyou sabbeen 

  e sabbee plenty IIgrunted eueebueg, puffing away at his pipe and
sitting up in bedb

 eou gettee in,  he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and
throwing the clothes to one sideb  e really did this in not only a civil
but a really kind and charitable wayb b stood looking at him a momentb
ror all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking
cannibalb uhat s all this fuss b have been making about, thought b to
myselfIIthe man s a human being eust as b amI he has eust as much reason
to fear me, as b have to be afraid of himb  etter sleep with a sober
cannibal than a drunken shristianb

 randlord,  said b,  tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or
whatever you call it  tell him to stop smoking, in short, and b will
turn in with himb  ut b don t fancy having a man smoking in bed with meb
bt s dangerousb  esides, b ain t insuredb 

Ihis being told to eueebueg, he at once complied, and again politely
motioned me to get into bedIIrolling over to one side as much as to
sayII b won t touch a leg of yeb 

  ood night, landlord,  said b,  you may gob 

b turned in, and never slept better in my lifeb



s r
Is   b Ihe sounterpaneb


bpon waking nest morning about daylight, b found eueebueg s arm thrown
over me in the most loving and affectionate mannerb eou had almost
thought b had been his wifeb Ihe counterpane was of patchwork, full of
odd little partiIcoloured sbuares and triangles  and this arm of his
tattooed all over with an interminable sretan labyrinth of a figure,
no two parts of which were of one precise shadeIIowing b suppose to
his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt
sleeves irregularly rolled up at various timesIIthis same arm of his, b
say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork builtb
bndeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when b first awoke, b could
hardly tell it from the built, they so blended their hues together  and
it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that b could tell that
eueebueg was hugging meb

 y sensations were strangeb ret me try to esplain themb uhen b was a
child, b well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me 
whether it was a reality or a dream, b never could entirely settleb
Ihe circumstance was thisb b had been cutting up some caper or otherIIb
think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as b had seen a little
sweep do a few days previous  and my stepmother who, somehow or other,
was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,IImy
mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to
bed, though it was only two o clock in the afternoon of the d st iune,
the longest day in the year in our hemisphereb b felt dreadfullyb  ut
there was no help for it, so up stairs b went to my little room in the
third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,
and with a bitter sigh got between the sheetsb

b lay there dismally calculating that sisteen entire hours must elapse
before b could hope for a resurrectionb oisteen hours in beds the
small of my back ached to think of itb rnd it was so light too  the
sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the
streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the houseb b felt worse
and worseIIat last b got up, dressed, and softly going down in my
stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself
at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good
slippering for my misbehaviour  anything indeed but condemning me to lie
abed such an unendurable length of timeb  ut she was the best and most
conscientious of stepmothers, and back b had to go to my roomb ror
several hours b lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than b
have ever done since, even from the greatest subsebuent misfortunesb rt
last b must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doce  and slowly
waking from itIIhalf steeped in dreamsIIb opened my eyes, and the before
sunIlit room was now wrapped in outer darknessb bnstantly b felt a shock
running through all my frame  nothing was to be seen, and nothing was
to be heard  but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mineb  y arm hung
over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form
or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my
bedIsideb ror what seemed ages piled on ages, b lay there, frocen with
the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand  yet ever thinking
that if b could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be
brokenb b knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me 
but waking in the morning, b shudderingly remembered it all, and for
days and weeks and months afterwards b lost myself in confounding
attempts to esplain the mysteryb say, to this very hour, b often puccle
myself with itb

sow, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the
supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to
those which b esperienced on waking up and seeing eueebueg s pagan
arm thrown round meb  ut at length all the past night s events soberly
recurred, one by one, in fised reality, and then b lay only alive to
the comical predicamentb ror though b tried to move his armIIunlock his
bridegroom claspIIyet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,
as though naught but death should part us twainb b now strove to rouse
himII eueebuegs IIbut his only answer was a snoreb b then rolled over,
my neck feeling as if it were in a horseIcollar  and suddenly felt a
slight scratchb Ihrowing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk
sleeping by the savage s side, as if it were a hatchetIfaced babyb r
pretty pickle, truly, thought b  abed here in a strange house in the
broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawks  eueebuegsIIin the name of
goodness, eueebueg, wakes  rt length, by dint of much wriggling, and
loud and incessant espostulations upon the unbecomingness of his
hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, b succeeded in
estracting a grunt  and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself
all over like a sewfoundland dog eust from the water, and sat up in bed,
stiff as a pikeIstaff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he
did not altogether remember how b came to be there, though a dim
consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over
himb  eanwhile, b lay buietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings
now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creatureb uhen, at
last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,
and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact  he eumped out upon
the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,
if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress
afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myselfb Ihinks b, eueebueg,
under the circumstances, this is a very civiliced overture  but, the
truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what
you will  it is marvellous how essentially polite they areb b pay this
particular compliment to eueebueg, because he treated me with so much
civility and consideration, while b was guilty of great rudeness 
staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions  for
the time my curiosity getting the better of my breedingb severtheless,
a man like eueebueg you don t see every day, he and his ways were well
worth unusual regardingb

 e commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one,
by the by, and thenIIstill minus his trowsersIIhe hunted up his bootsb
uhat under the heavens he did it for, b cannot tell, but his nest
movement was to crush himselfIIboots in hand, and hat onIIunder the bed 
when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, b inferred he was
hard at work booting himself  though by no law of propriety that b ever
heard of, is any man rebuired to be private when putting on his
bootsb  ut eueebueg, do you see, was a creature in the transition
stageIIneither caterpillar nor butterflyb  e was eust enough civiliced
to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible mannersb  is
education was not yet completedb  e was an undergraduateb bf he had not
been a small degree civiliced, he very probably would not have troubled
himself with boots at all  but then, if he had not been still a savage,
he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them onb rt
last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his
eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not
being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide
onesIIprobably not made to order eitherIIrather pinched and tormented
him at the first go off of a bitter cold morningb

oeeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the
street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view
into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that
eueebueg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on 
b begged him as well as b could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat,
and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possibleb  e
complied, and then proceeded to wash himselfb rt that time in the
morning any shristian would have washed his face  but eueebueg, to
my amacement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his
chest, arms, and handsb  e then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a
piece of hard soap on the washIstand centre table, dipped it into water
and commenced lathering his faceb b was watching to see where he kept
his racor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner,
slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little
on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall,
begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeksb Ihinks
b, eueebueg, this is using  ogers s best cutlery with a vengeanceb
rfterwards b wondered the less at this operation when b came to know of
what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how esceedingly sharp
the long straight edges are always keptb

Ihe rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of
the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey eacket, and sporting his
harpoon like a marshal s batonb

b buickly followed suit, and descending into the barIroom accosted the
grinning landlord very pleasantlyb b cherished no malice towards him,
though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my
bedfellowb

 owever, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a
good thing  the more s the pityb oo, if any one man, in his own
proper person, afford stuff for a good eoke to anybody, let him not be
backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in
that wayb rnd the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him,
be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think forb

Ihe barIroom was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the
night previous, and whom b had not as yet had a good look atb Ihey were
nearly all whalemen  chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and
sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers,
and ship keepers  a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards  an
unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey eackets for morning gownsb

eou could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashoreb Ihis
young fellow s healthy cheek is like a sunItoasted pear in hue, and
would seem to smell almost as musky  he cannot have been three days
landed from his bndian voyageb Ihat man nest him looks a few shades
lighter  you might say a touch of satin wood is in himb bn the
complesion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached
withal   s doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashoreb  ut who could show
a cheek like eueebuegn which, barred with various tints, seemed like the
rndes  western slope, to show forth in one array, contrasting climates,
cone by coneb

  rub, hos  now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went
to breakfastb

Ihey say that men who have seen the world, thereby become buite at ease
in manner, buite selfIpossessed in companyb sot always, thoughI redyard,
the great sew sngland traveller, and  ungo 
ark, the ocotch one  of all
men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlorb  ut perhaps the
mere crossing of oiberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as redyard did, or
the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart
of rfrica, which was the sum of poor  ungo s performancesIIthis kind of
travel, b say, may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social
polishb otill, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be had
anywhereb

Ihese reflections eust here are occasioned by the circumstance that
after we were all seated at the table, and b was preparing to hear some
good stories about whaling  to my no small surprise, nearly every
man maintained a profound silenceb rnd not only that, but they looked
embarrassedb ees, here were a set of seaIdogs, many of whom without the
slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seasIIentire
strangers to themIIand duelled them dead without winking  and yet, here
they sat at a social breakfast tableIIall of the same calling, all of
kindred tastesIIlooking round as sheepishly at each other as though they
had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the  reen  ountainsb
r curious sight  these bashful bears, these timid warrior whalemens

 ut as for eueebuegIIwhy, eueebueg sat there among themIIat the head of
the table, too, it so chanced  as cool as an icicleb Io be sure b cannot
say much for his breedingb  is greatest admirer could not have cordially
eustified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it
there without ceremony  reaching over the table with it, to the imminent
eeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards himb  ut
I rI was certainly very coolly done by him, and every one knows that in
most people s estimation, to do anything coolly is to do it genteellyb

ue will not speak of all eueebueg s peculiarities here  how he eschewed
coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks,
done rareb snough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the
rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawkIpipe, and was sitting
there buietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on, when b
sallied out for a strollb



s r
Is  ib Ihe otreetb


bf b had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish
an individual as eueebueg circulating among the polite society of a
civiliced town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first
daylight stroll through the streets of sew  edfordb

bn thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will
frebuently offer to view the bueerest looking nondescripts from foreign
partsb sven in  roadway and shestnut streets,  editerranean mariners
will sometimes eostle the affrighted ladiesb  egent otreet is not
unknown to rascars and  alays  and at  ombay, in the rpollo  reen, live
eankees have often scared the nativesb  ut sew  edford beats all uater
otreet and uappingb bn these lastImentioned haunts you see only sailors 
but in sew  edford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners 
savages outright  many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy fleshb bt
makes a stranger stareb

 ut, besides the reegeeans, Iongatobooarrs, srromanggoans, 
annangians,
and  righggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whalingIcraft
which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still
more curious, certainly more comicalb Ihere weekly arrive in this town
scores of green iermonters and sew  ampshire men, all athirst for gain
and glory in the fisheryb Ihey are mostly young, of stalwart frames 
fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the ase and snatch
the whaleIlanceb  any are as green as the  reen  ountains whence they
cameb bn some things you would think them but a few hours oldb rook
theres that chap strutting round the cornerb  e wears a beaver hat and
swallowItailed coat, girdled with a sailorIbelt and sheathIknifeb  ere
comes another with a sou Iwester and a bombacine cloakb

so townIbred dandy will compare with a countryIbred oneIIb mean a
downright bumpkin dandyIIa fellow that, in the dogIdays, will mow his
two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his handsb sow when a
country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished
reputation, and eoins the great whaleIfishery, you should see the
comical things he does upon reaching the seaportb bn bespeaking his
seaIoutfit, he orders bellIbuttons to his waistcoats  straps to his
canvas trowsersb rh, poor  ayIoeeds how bitterly will burst those straps
in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and
all, down the throat of the tempestb

 ut think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and
bumpkins to show her visitorsb sot at allb otill sew  edford is a bueer
placeb  ad it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this
day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of rabradorb
rs it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten one, they
look so bonyb Ihe town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live
in, in all sew snglandb bt is a land of oil, true enoughI but not like
sanaan  a land, also, of corn and wineb Ihe streets do not run with
milk  nor in the springItime do they pave them with fresh eggsb eet, in
spite of this, nowhere in all rmerica will you find more patricianIlike
houses  parks and gardens more opulent, than in sew  edfordb uhence came
theyn how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a countryn

 o and gace upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
mansion, and your buestion will be answeredb ees  all these brave houses
and flowery gardens came from the rtlantic, 
acific, and bndian oceansb
ene and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom
of the seab san  err rlesander perform a feat like thatn

bn sew  edford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their
daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises aIpieceb
eou must go to sew  edford to see a brilliant wedding  for, they say,
they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly
burn their lengths in spermaceti candlesb

bn summer time, the town is sweet to see  full of fine maplesIIlong
avenues of green and goldb rnd in rugust, high in air, the beautiful and
bountiful horseIchestnuts, candelabraIwise, proffer the passerIby their
tapering upright cones of congregated blossomsb oo omnipotent is art 
which in many a district of sew  edford has superinduced bright terraces
of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation s final
dayb

rnd the women of sew  edford, they bloom like their own red rosesb  ut
roses only bloom in summer  whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks
is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavensb slsewhere match that
bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in oalem, where they tell me the young
girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off
shore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous  oluccas instead of
the 
uritanic sandsb



s r
Is  db Ihe shapelb


bn this same sew  edford there stands a uhaleman s shapel, and few are
the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the bndian ecean or 
acific, who
fail to make a ounday visit to the spotb b am sure that b did notb

 eturning from my first morning stroll, b again sallied out upon this
special errandb Ihe sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving
sleet and mistb urapping myself in my shaggy eacket of the cloth called
bearskin, b fought my way against the stubborn stormb sntering, b
found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors  wives and
widowsb r muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks
of the stormb sach silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from
the other, as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicableb Ihe
chaplain had not yet arrived  and there these silent islands of men and
women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders,
masoned into the wall on either side the pulpitb Ihree of them ran
something like the following, but b do not pretend to buoteIII

ohaking off the sleet from my iceIglaced hat and eacket, b seated myself
near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see eueebueg near
meb rffected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gace
of incredulous curiosity in his countenanceb Ihis savage was the only
person present who seemed to notice my entrance  because he was the only
one who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading those frigid
inscriptions on the wallb uhether any of the relatives of the seamen
whose names appeared there were now among the congregation, b knew not 
but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery, and so plainly
did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings
of some unceasing grief, that b feel sure that here before me were
assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak
tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afreshb

flowers can sayIIhere,  s s lies my beloved  ye know not the desolation
that broods in bosoms like theseb uhat bitter blanks in those
blackIbordered marbles which cover no ashess uhat despair in those
immovable inscriptionss uhat deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in
the lines that seem to gnaw upon all raith, and refuse resurrections to
the beings who have placelessly perished without a graveb rs well might
those tablets stand in the cave of slephanta as hereb

bn what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included 
why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no
tales, though containing more secrets than the  oodwin oands  how it is
that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefis
so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if
he but embarks for the remotest bndies of this living earth  why the
rife bnsurance sompanies pay deathIforfeitures upon immortals  in what
eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies
antibue rdam who died sisty round centuries ago  how it is that we
still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are
dwelling in unspeakable bliss  why all the living so strive to hush all
the dead  wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a
whole cityb rll these things are not without their meaningsb

 ut raith, like a eackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these
dead doubts she gathers her most vital hopeb

bt needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a
santucket voyage, b regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky
light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen
who had gone before meb ees, bshmael, the same fate may be thineb  ut
somehow b grew merry againb relightful inducements to embark, fine
chance for promotion, it seemsIIaye, a stove boat will make me an
immortal by brevetb ees, there is death in this business of whalingIIa
speechlessly buick chaotic bundling of a man into sternityb  ut what
thenn  ethinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of rife and reathb
 ethinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true
substanceb  ethinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too
much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking that
thick water the thinnest of airb  ethinks my body is but the lees of my
better beingb bn fact take my body who will, take it b say, it is not
meb rnd therefore three cheers for santucket  and come a stove boat and

s r
Is   b Ihe 
ulpitb


b had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
robustness entered  immediately as the stormIpelted door flew back upon
admitting him, a buick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,
sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplainb ees, it
was the famous rather  apple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he
was a very great favouriteb  e had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his
youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministryb
rt the time b now write of, rather  apple was in the hardy winter of a
healthy old age  that sort of old age which seems merging into a second
flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone
certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloomIIthe spring verdure
peeping forth even beneath rebruary s snowb so one having previously
heard his history, could for the first time behold rather  apple without
the utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical
peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life
he had ledb uhen he entered b observed that he carried no umbrella, and
certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down
with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth eacket seemed almost to
drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbedb
 owever, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up
in a little space in an adeacent corner  when, arrayed in a decent suit,
he buietly approached the pulpitb

rike most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a
regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor,
seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect,
it seemed, had acted upon the hint of rather  apple, and finished the
pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like
those used in mounting a ship from a boat at seab Ihe wife of a whaling
captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted
manIropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and
stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering what
manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad tasteb  alting for
an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the
ornamental knobs of the manIropes, rather  apple cast a look upwards,
and then with a truly sailorIlike but still reverential desterity, hand
over hand, mounted the steps as if ascending the mainItop of his vesselb

Ihe perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with
swinging ones, were of clothIcovered rope, only the rounds were of wood,
so that at every step there was a eointb rt my first glimpse of the
pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,
these eoints in the present instance seemed unnecessaryb ror b was not
prepared to see rather  apple after gaining the height, slowly turn
round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder
step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him
impregnable in his little euebecb

b pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for thisb
rather  apple eneoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity,
that b could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks
of the stageb so, thought b, there must be some sober reason for this
thing  furthermore, it must symbolice something unseenb san it be,
then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual
withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties and connesionsn
ees, for replenished with the meat and wine of the word, to the faithful
man of  od, this pulpit, b see, is a selfIcontaining strongholdIIa lofty
shrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the wallsb

 ut the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,
borrowed from the chaplain s former seaIfaringsb  etween the marble
cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back
was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating
against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy
breakersb  ut high above the flying scud and darkIrolling clouds, there
floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel s
face  and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the
ship s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into
the iictory s plank where selson fellb  rh, noble ship,  the angel
seemed to say,  beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy
helm  for los the sun is breaking through  the clouds are rolling
offIIserenest acure is at handb 

sor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same seaItaste that
had achieved the ladder and the pictureb bts panelled front was in
the likeness of a ship s bluff bows, and the  oly  ible rested on a
proeecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship s fiddleIheaded
beakb

uhat could be more full of meaningnIIfor the pulpit is ever this earth s
foremost part  all the rest comes in its rear  the pulpit leads the
worldb rrom thence it is the storm of  od s buick wrath is first
descried, and the bow must bear the earliest bruntb rrom thence it is
the  od of breeces fair or foul is first invoked for favourable windsb
ees, the world s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete 
and the pulpit is its prowb

rather  apple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered
the scattered people to condenseb  otarboard gangway, theres side away
to larboardIIlarboard gangway to starboards  idshipss midshipss 

Ihere was a low rumbling of heavy seaIboots among the benches, and a
still slighter shuffling of women s shoes, and all was buiet again, and
every eye on the preacherb

 e paused a little  then kneeling in the pulpit s bows, folded his large
brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered
a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the
bottom of the seab

Ihis ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of
a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fogIIin such tones he
commenced reading the following hymn  but changing his manner towards
the concluding stancas, burst forth with a pealing esultation and eoyII

      Ihe ribs and terrors in the whale,
     rrched over me a dismal gloom,
     uhile all  od s sunIlit waves rolled by,
     rnd lift me deepening down to doomb

      b saw the opening maw of hell,
     uith endless pains and sorrows there 
     uhich none but they that feel can tellII
     eh, b was plunging to despairb

      bn black distress, b called my  od,
     uhen b could scarce believe him mine,
      e bowed his ear to my complaintsII
     so more the whale did me confineb

      uith speed he flew to my relief,
     rs on a radiant dolphin borne 
     rwful, yet bright, as lightning shone
     Ihe face of my reliverer  odb

       y song for ever shall record
     Ihat terrible, that eoyful hour 
     b give the glory to my  od,
      is all the mercy and the powerb 


searly all eoined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the
howling of the stormb r brief pause ensued  the preacher slowly turned
over the leaves of the  ible, and at last, folding his hand down upon
the proper page, saidI   eloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the

lesson that the book of ionah teachesn ohipmates, it is a twoIstranded
lesson  a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot
of the living  odb rs sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it
is a story of the sin, hardIheartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the
swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and
eoy of ionahb rs with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of
rmittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of  odIInever
mind now what that command was, or how conveyedIIwhich he found a hard
commandb  ut all the things that  od would have us do are hard for us to
doIIremember thatIIand hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to
persuadeb rnd if we obey  od, we must disobey ourselves  and it is in
this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying  od consistsb

 uith this sin of disobedience in him, ionah still further flouts at
 od, by seeking to flee from  imb  e thinks that a ship made by men will
carry him into countries where  od does not reign, but only the saptains
of this earthb  e skulks about the wharves of ioppa, and seeks a ship
that s bound for Iarshishb Ihere lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded
meaning hereb  y all accounts Iarshish could have been no other city
than the modern sadicb Ihat s the opinion of learned menb rnd where is
sadic, shipmatesn sadic is in opain  as far by water, from ioppa,
as ionah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when the
rtlantic was an almost unknown seab  ecause ioppa, the modern iaffa,
shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the  editerranean, the
oyrian  and Iarshish or sadic more than two thousand miles to the
westward from that, eust outside the otraits of  ibraltarb oee ye

slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his  od  prowling among the
shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seasb oo disordered,

days, ionah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested
ere he touched a deckb  ow plainly he s a fugitives no baggage, not a
hatIbos, valise, or carpetIbag,IIno friends accompany him to the wharf
with their adieusb rt last, after much dodging search, he finds the
Iarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo  and as he steps on
board to see its saptain in the cabin, all the sailors for the moment
desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger s evil eyeb
ionah sees this  but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence 
in vain essays his wretched smileb otrong intuitions of the man assure
the mariners he can be no innocentb bn their gamesome but still serious
way, one whispers to the otherII iack, he s robbed a widow   or,  ioe,

adulterer that broke eail in old  omorrah, or belike, one of the missing
murderers from oodomb  rnother runs to read the bill that s stuck
against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering
five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide, and
containing a description of his personb  e reads, and looks from ionah
to the bill  while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round ionah,
prepared to lay their hands upon himb rrighted ionah trembles, and
summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a
cowardb  e will not confess himself suspected  but that itself is strong
suspicionb oo he makes the best of it  and when the sailors find him
not to be the man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends
into the cabinb

taken with the contest, this is full of meaningb

in any, but whose cupidity esposes it only in the pennilessb bn this
world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without
a passport  whereas iirtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiersb

 Ihou lookest like it,  says the saptain,  there s thy roomb  ionah
enters, and would lock the door, but the lock contains no keyb  earing
him foolishly fumbling there, the saptain laughs lowly to himself, and
mutters something about the doors of convicts  cells being never allowed
to be locked withinb rll dressed and dusty as he is, ionah throws
himself into his berth, and finds the little stateIroom ceiling almost
resting on his foreheadb Ihe air is close, and ionah gaspsb Ihen, in
that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship s waterIline, ionah
feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the whale
shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels  wardsb

 ocrewed at its asis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly
oscillates in ionah s room  and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf
with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all,
though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent oblibuity with
reference to the room  though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it
but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it hungb Ihe lamp
alarms and frightens ionah  as lying in his berth his tormented eyes
roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds no
refuge for his restless glanceb  ut that contradiction in the lamp more
and more appals himb Ihe floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awryb
 ehs so my conscience hangs in mes  he groans,  straight upwards, so it
burns  but the chambers of my soul are all in crookednesss 

 rike one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still
reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the
 oman raceIhorse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him  as
one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish,
praying  od for annihilation until the fit be passed  and at last amid
the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the
man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there s naught
to staunch it  so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, ionah s prodigy
of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleepb

 rnd now the time of tide has come  the ship casts off her cables  and
from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Iarshish, all careening,
glides to seab Ihat ship, my friends, was the first of recorded
smugglerss the contraband was ionahb  ut the sea rebels  he will not
bear the wicked burdenb r dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to
breakb  ut now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her 
when boses, bales, and ears are clattering overboard  when the wind
is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with
trampling feet right over ionah s head  in all this raging tumult, ionah
sleeps his hideous sleepb  e sees no black sky and raging sea, feels not
the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the
mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after
himb rye, shipmates, ionah was gone down into the sides of the shipIIa
berth in the cabin as b have taken it, and was fast asleepb  ut the
frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead ear,  uhat
meanest thou, e, sleepers arises  otartled from his lethargy by that
direful cry, ionah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the deck,
grasps a shroud, to look out upon the seab  ut at that moment he is
sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarksb uave after
wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs roaring
fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloatb
rnd ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep
gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast ionah sees the rearing
bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the
tormented deepb

 Ierrors upon terrors run shouting through his soulb bn all his cringing
attitudes, the  odIfugitive is now too plainly knownb Ihe sailors mark
him  more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last,
fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to high  eaven,
they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this great tempest was
upon themb Ihe lot is ionah s  that discovered, then how furiously they
mob him with their buestionsb  uhat is thine occupationn uhence comest
thoun Ihy countryn uhat peoplen  ut mark now, my shipmates, the behavior
of poor ionahb Ihe eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where
from  whereas, they not only receive an answer to those buestions,
but likewise another answer to a buestion not put by them, but the
unsolicited answer is forced from ionah by the hard hand of  od that is
upon himb

who hath made the sea and the dry lands  rear him, e ionahn rye, well
mightest thou fear the rord  od I sss otraightway, he now goes on to
make a full confession  whereupon the mariners became more and more
appalled, but still are pitifulb ror when ionah, not yet supplicating
 od for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his
deserts,IIwhen wretched ionah cries out to them to take him and cast him
forth into the sea, for he knew that for  bo sake this great tempest
was upon them  they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means to
save the shipb  ut all in vain  the indignant gale howls louder 
then, with one hand raised invokingly to  od, with the other they not
unreluctantly lay hold of ionahb

 rnd now behold ionah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea 
when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea
is still, as ionah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth
water behindb  e goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless
commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into
the yawning eaws awaiting him  and the whale shootsIto all his ivory
teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prisonb Ihen ionah prayed unto
the rord out of the fish s bellyb  ut observe his prayer, and learn a
weighty lessonb ror sinful as he is, ionah does not weep and wail for
direct deliveranceb  e feels that his dreadful punishment is eustb  e
leaves all his deliverance to  od, contenting himself with this, that
spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards  is holy
templeb rnd here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance  not
clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishmentb rnd how pleasing to
 od was this conduct in ionah, is shown in the eventual deliverance of
him from the sea and the whaleb ohipmates, b do not place ionah before
you to be copied for his sin but b do place him before you as a model
for repentanceb oin not  but if you do, take heed to repent of it like
ionahb 

uhile he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,
slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,
when describing ionah s seaIstorm, seemed tossed by a storm himselfb
 is deep chest heaved as with a groundIswell  his tossed arms seemed the
warring elements at work  and the thunders that rolled away from off his
swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his simple
hearers look on him with a buick fear that was strange to themb

Ihere now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves
of the  ook once more  and, at last, standing motionless, with closed
eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with  od and himselfb

 ut again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly,
with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these
wordsI

 ohipmates,  od has laid but one hand upon you  both his hands press
upon meb b have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that
ionah teaches to all sinners  and therefore to ye, and still more to me,
for b am a greater sinner than yeb rnd now how gladly would b come down
from this mastIhead and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and
listen as you listen, while some one of you reads  s that other and more
awful lesson which ionah teaches to  s, as a pilot of the living  odb
 ow being an anointed pilotIprophet, or speaker of true things, and
bidden by the rord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a
wicked sineveh, ionah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled
from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his  od by taking
ship at ioppab  ut  od is everywhere  Iarshish he never reachedb rs we
have seen,  od came upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to
living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him along  into the
midst of the seas,  where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand
fathoms down, and  the weeds were wrapped about his head,  and all the
watery world of woe bowled over himb eet even then beyond the reach of
any plummetII out of the belly of hell IIwhen the whale grounded upon
the ocean s utmost bones, even then,  od heard the engulphed, repenting

shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching
up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and
earth  and  vomited out ionah upon the dry land   when the word of the
rord came a second time  and ionah, bruised and beatenIIhis ears, like

 e said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with
his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed,
and he was left alone in the placeb



s r
Is   nb r  osom rriendb


 eturning to the opouterIbnn from the shapel, b found eueebueg there
buite alone  he having left the shapel before the benediction some timeb
 e was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove
hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little
negro idol of his  peering hard into its face, and with a eackIknife
gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to himself in his
heathenish wayb

 ut being now interrupted, he put up the image  and pretty soon, going
to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap
began counting the pages with deliberate regularity  at every fiftieth
pageIIas b fanciedIIstopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and
giving utterance to a longIdrawn gurgling whistle of astonishmentb  e
would then begin again at the nest fifty  seeming to commence at number
one each time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was
only by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his
astonishment at the multitude of pages was escitedb

uith much interest b sat watching himb oavage though he was, and
hideously marred about the faceIIat least to my tasteIIhis countenance
yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeableb eou cannot
hide the soulb Ihrough all his unearthly tattooings, b thought b saw
the traces of a simple honest heart  and in his large, deep eyes,
fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a
thousand devilsb rnd besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing
about the 
agan, which even his uncouthness could not altogether maimb
 e looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditorb
uhether it was, too, that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn
out in freer and brighter relief, and looked more espansive than it
otherwise would, this b will not venture to decide  but certain it was
his head was phrenologically an escellent oneb bt may seem ridiculous,
but it reminded me of  eneral uashington s head, as seen in the popular
busts of himb bt had the same long regularly graded retreating slope
from above the brows, which were likewise very proeecting, like two
long promontories thickly wooded on topb eueebueg was  eorge uashington
cannibalistically developedb

uhilst b was thus closely scanning him, halfIpretending meanwhile to be
looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence,
never troubled himself with so much as a single glance  but appeared
wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous bookb
sonsidering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night
previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm b had found
thrown over me upon waking in the morning, b thought this indifference
of his very strangeb  ut savages are strange beings  at times you do not
know esactly how to take themb rt first they are overawing  their calm
selfIcollectedness of simplicity seems a oocratic wisdomb b had noticed
also that eueebueg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the
other seamen in the innb  e made no advances whatever  appeared to have
no desire to enlarge the circle of his acbuaintancesb rll this struck
me as mighty singular  yet, upon second thoughts, there was something
almost sublime in itb  ere was a man some twenty thousand miles from
home, by the way of sape  orn, that isIIwhich was the only way he could
get thereIIthrown among people as strange to him as though he were in
the planet iupiter  and yet he seemed entirely at his ease  preserving
the utmost serenity  content with his own companionship  always ebual to
himselfb ourely this was a touch of fine philosophy  though no doubt he
had never heard there was such a thing as thatb  ut, perhaps, to be
true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living or
so strivingb oo soon as b hear that such or such a man gives himself
out for a philosopher, b conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he
must have  broken his digesterb 

rs b sat there in that now lonely room  the fire burning low, in that
mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then
only glows to be looked at  the evening shades and phantoms gathering
round the casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain 
the storm booming without in solemn swells  b began to be sensible of
strange feelingsb b felt a melting in meb so more my splintered heart
and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish worldb Ihis soothing
savage had redeemed itb Ihere he sat, his very indifference speaking a
nature in which there lurked no civiliced hypocrisies and bland deceitsb
uild he was  a very sight of sights to see  yet b began to feel myself
mysteriously drawn towards himb rnd those same things that would have
repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew meb b ll
try a pagan friend, thought b, since shristian kindness has proved but
hollow courtesyb b drew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs
and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhileb rt first he little
noticed these advances  but presently, upon my referring to his last
night s hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be
bedfellowsb b told him yes  whereat b thought he looked pleased, perhaps
a little complimentedb

ue then turned over the book together, and b endeavored to esplain to
him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures
that were in itb Ihus b soon engaged his interest  and from that we went
to eabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen
in this famous townb ooon b proposed a social smoke  and, producing
his pouch and tomahawk, he buietly offered me a puffb rnd then we sat
eschanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it regularly
passing between usb

bf there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the 
agan s
breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and left
us croniesb  e seemed to take to me buite as naturally and unbiddenly as
b to him  and when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against
mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that henceforth we were
married  meaning, in his country s phrase, that we were bosom friends 
he would gladly die for me, if need should beb bn a countryman, this
sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature, a thing
to be much distrusted  but in this simple savage those old rules would
not applyb

rfter supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room
togetherb  e made me a present of his embalmed head  took out his
enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out
some thirty dollars in silver  then spreading them on the table, and
mechanically dividing them into two ebual portions, pushed one of them
towards me, and said it was mineb b was going to remonstrate  but he
silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers  pocketsb b let them stayb
 e then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed
the paper fireboardb  y certain signs and symptoms, b thought he seemed
ansious for me to eoin him  but well knowing what was to follow, b
deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, b would comply or
otherwiseb

b was a good shristian  born and bred in the bosom of the infallible

resbyterian shurchb  ow then could b unite with this wild idolator in
worshipping his piece of woodn  ut what is worshipn thought bb ro

in his  ergo, b must turn idolatorb oo b kindled the shavings  helped
prop up the innocent little idol  offered him burnt biscuit with
eueebueg  salamed before him twice or thrice  kissed his nose  and that
done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences
and all the worldb  ut we did not go to sleep without some little chatb

 ow it is b know not  but there is no place like a bed for confidential
disclosures between friendsb  an and wife, they say, there open the very
bottom of their souls to each other  and some old couples often lie
and chat over old times till nearly morningb Ihus, then, in our hearts 
honeymoon, lay b and eueebuegIIa cosy, loving pairb



s r
Is    b sightgownb


ue had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and
eueebueg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs
over mine, and then drawing them back  so entirely sociable and free
and easy were we  when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what
little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like
getting up again, though dayIbreak was yet some way down the futureb

ees, we became very wakeful  so much so that our recumbent position
began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves
sitting up  the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the
headIboard with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two
noses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warmingIpansb ue felt
very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors 
indeed out of bedIclothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the
roomb Ihe more so, b say, because truly to eneoy bodily warmth, some
small part of you must be cold, for there is no buality in this world
that is not what it is merely by contrastb sothing esists in itselfb bf
you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so
a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any moreb  ut if,
like eueebueg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown
of your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general
consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warmb ror this
reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which
is one of the lusurious discomforts of the richb ror the height of this
sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and
your snugness and the cold of the outer airb Ihen there you lie like the
one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystalb

ue had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at
once b thought b would open my eyes  for when between sheets, whether
by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, b have a way of always
keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness
of being in bedb  ecause no man can ever feel his own identity aright
escept his eyes be closed  as if darkness were indeed the proper element
of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey partb bpon
opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and selfIcreated
darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated
twelveIo clockIatInight, b esperienced a disagreeable revulsionb sor did
b at all obeect to the hint from eueebueg that perhaps it were best to
strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake  and besides he felt
a strong desire to have a few buiet puffs from his Iomahawkb  e it said,
that though b had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the
bed the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff preeudices grow when
love once comes to bend themb ror now b liked nothing better than to
have eueebueg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full
of such serene household eoy thenb b no more felt unduly concerned for
the landlord s policy of insuranceb b was only alive to the condensed
confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real
friendb uith our shaggy eackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed
the Iomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a
blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the newIlit
lampb

uhether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far
distant scenes, b know not, but he now spoke of his native island  and,
eager to hear his history, b begged him to go on and tell itb  e gladly
compliedb Ihough at the time b but ill comprehended not a few of his
words, yet subsebuent disclosures, when b had become more familiar with
his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story such as
it may prove in the mere skeleton b giveb



s r
Is   db  iographicalb


eueebueg was a native of  okovoko, an island far away to the uest and
oouthb bt is not down in any map  true places never areb

uhen a newIhatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in
a grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green
sapling  even then, in eueebueg s ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire
to see something more of shristendom than a specimen whaler or twob  is
father was a  igh shief, a ning  his uncle a  igh 
riest  and on the
maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconbuerable
warriorsb Ihere was escellent blood in his veinsIIroyal stuff  though
sadly vitiated, b fear, by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his
untutored youthb

r oag  arbor ship visited his father s bay, and eueebueg sought a
passage to shristian landsb  ut the ship, having her full complement of
seamen, spurned his suit  and not all the ning his father s influence
could prevailb  ut eueebueg vowed a vowb rlone in his canoe, he paddled
off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when
she buitted the islandb en one side was a coral reef  on the other a low
tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the
waterb  iding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its
prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand  and when the
ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out  gained her side  with
one backward dash of his foot capsiced and sank his canoe  climbed up
the chains  and throwing himself at full length upon the deck, grappled
a ringIbolt there, and swore not to let it go, though hacked in piecesb

bn vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard  suspended a
cutlass over his naked wrists  eueebueg was the son of a ning, and
eueebueg budged notb otruck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his wild
desire to visit shristendom, the captain at last relented, and told
him he might make himself at homeb  ut this fine young savageIIthis sea

rince of uales, never saw the saptain s cabinb Ihey put him down among
the sailors, and made a whaleman of himb  ut like scar 
eter content to
toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, eueebueg disdained no seeming
ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his
untutored countrymenb ror at bottomIIso he told meIIhe was actuated by a
profound desire to learn among the shristians, the arts whereby to
make his people still happier than they were  and more than that,
still better than they wereb  ut, alass the practices of whalemen soon
convinced him that even shristians could be both miserable and wicked 
infinitely more so, than all his father s heathensb rrrived at last in
old oag  arbor  and seeing what the sailors did there  and then going on
to santucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also,
poor eueebueg gave it up for lostb Ihought he, it s a wicked world in
all meridians  b ll die a paganb

rnd thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these shristians,
wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberishb  ence the bueer
ways about him, though now some time from homeb

 y hints, b asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having
a coronation  since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he
being very old and feeble at the last accountsb  e answered no, not yet 
and added that he was fearful shristianity, or rather shristians, had
unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan
nings before himb  ut by and by, he said, he would return,IIas soon as
he felt himself bapticed againb ror the nonce, however, he proposed to
sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceansb Ihey had made a
harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre nowb

b asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future
movementsb  e answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocationb bpon
this, b told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my
intention to sail out of santucket, as being the most promising port for
an adventurous whaleman to embark fromb  e at once resolved to accompany
me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch,
the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my every hap 
with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the 
otluck of both worldsb
Io all this b eoyously assented  for besides the affection b now felt
for eueebueg, he was an esperienced harpooneer, and as such, could not
fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant
of the mysteries of whaling, though well acbuainted with the sea, as
known to merchant seamenb

 is story being ended with his pipe s last dying puff, eueebueg embraced
me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we
rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon were
sleepingb


s r
Is    b uheelbarrowb


sest morning,  onday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,
for a block, b settled my own and comrade s bill  using, however, my
comrade s moneyb Ihe grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed
amacingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between
me and eueebuegIIespecially as 
eter soffin s cock and bull stories
about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person
whom b now companied withb

ue borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own
poor carpetIbag, and eueebueg s canvas sack and hammock, away we went
down to  the  oss,  the little santucket packet schooner moored at the
wharfb rs we were going along the people stared  not at eueebueg
so muchIIfor they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their
streets,IIbut at seeing him and me upon such confidential termsb  ut we
heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and eueebueg
now and then stopping to adeust the sheath on his harpoon barbsb b asked
him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and
whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoonsb Io this, in
substance, he replied, that though what b hinted was true enough, yet
he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of
assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate
with the hearts of whalesb bn short, like many inland reapers
and mowers, who go into the farmers  meadows armed with their own
scythesIIthough in no wise obliged to furnish themIIeven so, eueebueg,
for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoonb

ohifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about
the first wheelbarrow he had ever seenb bt was in oag  arborb Ihe owners
of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his
heavy chest to his boarding houseb sot to seem ignorant about the
thingIIthough in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in
which to manage the barrowIIeueebueg puts his chest upon it  lashes it

bpon this, he told me another storyb Ihe people of his island of
 okovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts espress the fragrant water
of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl  and
this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided
mat where the feast is heldb sow a certain grand merchant ship once
touched at  okovoko, and its commanderIIfrom all accounts, a very
stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captainIIthis
commander was invited to the wedding feast of eueebueg s sister, a
pretty young princess eust turned of tenb uell  when all the wedding
guests were assembled at the bride s bamboo cottage, this saptain
marches in, and being assigned the post of honour, placed himself over
against the punchbowl, and between the  igh 
riest and his maeesty the
ning, eueebueg s fatherb  race being said,IIfor those people have their
grace as well as weIIthough eueebueg told me that unlike us, who at such
times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the
ducks, glance upwards to the great  iver of all feastsII race, b say,
being said, the  igh 
riest opens the banbuet by the immemorial ceremony
of the island  that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers
into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulatesb oeeing himself
placed nest the 
riest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking
himselfIIbeing saptain of a shipIIas having plain precedence over a
mere island ning, especially in the ning s own houseIIthe saptain coolly
proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl IItaking it b suppose for a
huge fingerIglassb  sow,  said eueebueg,  what you tink nownIIridn t our

rt last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schoonerb
 oisting sail, it glided down the rcushnet riverb en one side, sew
 edford rose in terraces of streets, their iceIcovered trees all
glittering in the clear, cold airb  uge hills and mountains of casks on
casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the worldIwandering
whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last  while from others
came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and
forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises were on the
start  that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a
second  and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever
and for ayeb ouch is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all
earthly effortb

 aining the more open water, the bracing breece wased fresh  the little
 oss tossed the buick foam from her bows, as a young colt his snortingsb
 ow b snuffed that Iartar airsIIhow b spurned that turnpike earthsIIthat
common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and
hoofs  and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will
permit no recordsb

rt the same foamIfountain, eueebueg seemed to drink and reel with meb
 is dusky nostrils swelled apart  he showed his filed and pointed teethb
en, on we flew  and our offing gained, the  oss did homage to the
blast  ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the oultanb oideways
leaning, we sideways darted  every ropeyarn tingling like a wire  the
two tall masts buckling like bndian canes in land tornadoesb oo full of
this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that
for some time we did not notice the eeering glances of the passengers, a
lubberIlike assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so
companionable  as though a white man were anything more dignified than a
whitewashed negrob  ut there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who,
by their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of
all verdureb eueebueg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him
behind his backb b thought the bumpkin s hour of doom was comeb rropping
his harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost
miraculous desterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air 
then slightly tapping his stern in midIsomerset, the fellow landed with
bursting lungs upon his feet, while eueebueg, turning his back upon him,
lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puffb

 saptings saptings  yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer 
 sapting, sapting, here s the devilb 

  allo, hyouh sir,  cried the saptain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking
up to eueebueg,  what in thunder do you mean by thatn ron t you know you
might have killed that chapn 

 uhat him sayn  said eueebueg, as he mildly turned to meb

  e say,  said b,  that you came near killIe that man there,  pointing
to the still shivering greenhornb

try any more of your tricks aboard here  so mind your eyeb 

 ut it so happened eust then, that it was high time for the saptain to
mind his own eyeb Ihe prodigious strain upon the mainIsail had parted
the weatherIsheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to
side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deckb Ihe poor
fellow whom eueebueg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard  all
hands were in a panic  and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,
seemed madnessb bt flew from right to left, and back again, almost
in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of
snapping into splintersb sothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of
being done  those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the
boom as if it were the lower eaw of an esasperated whaleb bn the
midst of this consternation, eueebueg dropped deftly to his knees, and
crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one
end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it
round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the nest eerk, the spar
was that way trapped, and all was safeb Ihe schooner was run into the
wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, eueebueg,
stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of
a leapb ror three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog,
throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing
his brawny shoulders through the freecing foamb b looked at the grand
and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be savedb Ihe greenhorn had gone
downb ohooting himself perpendicularly from the water, eueebueg, now
took an instant s glance around him, and seeming to see eust how matters
were, dived down and disappearedb r few minutes more, and he rose again,
one arm still striking out, and with the other dragging a lifeless formb
Ihe boat soon picked them upb Ihe poor bumpkin was restoredb rll hands

bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying

s r
Is    b santucketb


sothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning  so, after a
fine run, we safely arrived in santucketb

santuckets Iake out your map and look at itb oee what a real corner of
the world it occupies  how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely
than the sddystone lighthouseb rook at itIIa mere hillock, and elbow of
sand  all beach, without a backgroundb Ihere is more sand there than
you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paperb oome
gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they
don t grow naturally  that they import sanada thistles  that they have
to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask  that
pieces of wood in santucket are carried about like bits of the true
cross in  ome  that people there plant toadstools before their houses,
to get under the shade in summer time  that one blade of grass makes an
oasis, three blades in a day s walk a prairie  that they wear buicksand
shoes, something like raplander snowIshoes  that they are so shut up,
belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island
of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will
sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtlesb  ut these
estravagancas only show that santucket is no bllinoisb

rook now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was
settled by the redImenb Ihus goes the legendb bn olden times an eagle
swooped down upon the sew sngland coast, and carried off an infant
bndian in his talonsb uith loud lament the parents saw their child borne
out of sight over the wide watersb Ihey resolved to follow in the same
directionb oetting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they
discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory casket,IIthe
poor little bndian s skeletonb

uhat wonder, then, that these santucketers, born on a beach, should take
to the sea for a livelihoods Ihey first caught crabs and buohogs in
the sand  grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel  more
esperienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod  and at last,
launching a navy of great ships on the sea, esplored this watery world 
put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it  peeped in
at  ehring s otraits  and in all seasons and all oceans declared
everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the
flood  most monstrous and most mountainouss Ihat  immalehan, saltIsea
 astodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that
his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and
malicious assaultss

rnd thus have these naked santucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from
their antIhill in the sea, overrun and conbuered the watery world like
so many rlesanders  parcelling out among them the rtlantic, 
acific, and
bndian oceans, as the three pirate powers did 
olandb ret rmerica add
 esico to Iesas, and pile suba upon sanada  let the snglish overswarm
all bndia, and hang out their blacing banner from the sun  two thirds
of this terrabueous globe are the santucketer sb ror the sea is his  he
owns it, as smperors own empires  other seamen having but a right of
way through itb  erchant ships are but estension bridges  armed ones but
floating forts  even pirates and privateers, though following the sea
as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of
the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the
bottomless deep itselfb Ihe santucketer, he alone resides and riots on
the sea  he alone, in  ible language, goes down to it in ships  to and
fro ploughing it as his own special plantationb I s s is his home  I s s
lies his business, which a soah s flood would not interrupt, though it
overwhelmed all the millions in shinab  e lives on the sea, as prairie
cocks in the prairie  he hides among the waves, he climbs them as
chamois hunters climb the rlpsb ror years he knows not the land  so
that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more
strangely than the moon would to an sarthsmanb uith the landless gull,
that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows 
so at nightfall, the santucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails,
and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of
walruses and whalesb



s r
Is   db showderb


bt was buite late in the evening when the little  oss came snugly
to anchor, and eueebueg and b went ashore  so we could attend to no
business that day, at least none but a supper and a bedb Ihe landlord of
the opouterIbnn had recommended us to his cousin  osea  ussey of the
Iry 
ots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept
hotels in all santucket, and moreover he had assured us that sousin
 osea, as he called him, was famous for his chowdersb bn short, he
plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try potIluck at
the Iry 
otsb  ut the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow
warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the
larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a
corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first
man we met where the place wasI these crooked directions of his very
much puccled us at first, especially as, at the outset, eueebueg
insisted that the yellow warehouseIIour first point of departureIImust
be left on the larboard hand, whereas b had understood 
eter soffin to
say it was on the starboardb  owever, by dint of beating about a little
in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant
to inbuire the way, we at last came to something which there was no
mistakingb

Iwo enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses  ears,
swung from the crossItrees of an old topImast, planted in front of an
old doorwayb Ihe horns of the crossItrees were sawed off on the other
side, so that this old topImast looked not a little like a gallowsb

erhaps b was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but b
could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgivingb r sort of
crick was in my neck as b gaced up to the two remaining horns  yes, Iue
of them, one for eueebueg, and one for meb bt s ominous, thinks bb r
soffin my bnnkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port  tombstones
staring at me in the whalemen s chapel  and here a gallowss and a pair
of prodigious black pots toos rre these last throwing out oblibue hints
touching Iophetn

b was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman
with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,
under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an ineured
eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen
shirtb

  et along with ye,  said she to the man,  or b ll be combing yes 

 some on, eueebueg,  said b,  all rightb Ihere s  rsb  usseyb 

rnd so it turned out   rb  osea  ussey being from home, but leaving
 rsb  ussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairsb bpon
making known our desires for a supper and a bed,  rsb  ussey, postponing
further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and
seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded
repast, turned round to us and saidII slam or sodn 

 uhat s that about sods, ma amn  said b, with much politenessb

 slam or sodn  she repeatedb

 r clam for suppern a cold clam  is I rI what you mean,  rsb  usseyn 
says b,  but that s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter
time, ain t it,  rsb  usseyn 

 ut being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple
ohirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing
but the word  clam,   rsb  ussey hurried towards an open door leading to
the kitchen, and bawling out  clam for two,  disappearedb

 eueebueg,  said b,  do you think that we can make out a supper for us
both on one clamn 

 owever, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the
apparently cheerless prospect before usb  ut when that smoking chowder
came in, the mystery was delightfully esplainedb eh, sweet friendss
hearken to meb bt was made of small euicy clams, scarcely bigger than
hacel nuts, mised with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into
little flakes  the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned
with pepper and saltb eur appetites being sharpened by the frosty
voyage, and in particular, eueebueg seeing his favourite fishing food
before him, and the chowder being surpassingly escellent, we despatched
it with great espeditionI when leaning back a moment and bethinking
me of  rsb  ussey s clam and cod announcement, b thought b would try
a little esperimentb otepping to the kitchen door, b uttered the word
 cod  with great emphasis, and resumed my seatb bn a few moments the
savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good
time a fine codIchowder was placed before usb

ue resumed business  and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks b
to myself, b wonder now if this here has any effect on the headn
uhat s that stultifying saying about chowderIheaded peoplen   ut look,
eueebueg, ain t that a live eel in your bowln uhere s your harpoonn 

rishiest of all fishy places was the Iry 
ots, which well deserved
its name  for the pots there were always boiling chowdersb showder for
breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you
began to look for fishIbones coming through your clothesb Ihe area
before the house was paved with clamIshellsb  rsb  ussey wore a polished
necklace of codfish vertebra  and  osea  ussey had his account books
bound in superior old sharkIskinb Ihere was a fishy flavor to the milk,
too, which b could not at all account for, till one morning happening
to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen s boats, b saw
 osea s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the
sand with each foot in a cod s decapitated head, looking very slipIshod,
b assure yeb

oupper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from  rsb  ussey
concerning the nearest way to bed  but, as eueebueg was about to precede
me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his
harpoon  she allowed no harpoon in her chambersb  uhy notn  said b 
 every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoonIIbut why notn    ecause
it s dangerous,  says sheb  sver since young otiggs coming from that
unfort nt v y ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with
only three barrels of hileh, was found dead in my first floor back, with
his harpoon in his side  ever since then b allow no boarders to take
sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at nightb oo,  rb eueebueg  ifor
she had learned his namei,  b will eust take this here iron, and keep
it for you till morningb  ut the chowder  clam or cod toImorrow for
breakfast, menn

varietyb 



s r
Is   ib Ihe ohipb


bn bed we concocted our plans for the morrowb  ut to my surprise and
no small concern, eueebueg now gave me to understand, that he had been
diligently consulting eoeoIIthe name of his black little godIIand eoeo
had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it
everyway, that instead of our going together among the whalingIfleet in
harbor, and in concert selecting our craft  instead of this, b say, eoeo
earnestly eneoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly
with me, inasmuch as eoeo purposed befriending us  and, in order to
do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, b,
bshmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it
had turned out by chance  and in that vessel b must immediately ship
myself, for the present irrespective of eueebuegb

b have forgotten to mention that, in many things, eueebueg placed great
confidence in the escellence of eoeo s eudgment and surprising forecast
of things  and cherished eoeo with considerable esteem, as a rather good
sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all
cases did not succeed in his benevolent designsb

sow, this plan of eueebueg s, or rather eoeo s, touching the selection
of our craft  b did not like that plan at allb b had not a little relied
upon eueebueg s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry
us and our fortunes securelyb  ut as all my remonstrances produced
no effect upon eueebueg, b was obliged to acbuiesce  and accordingly
prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort
of energy and vigor, that should buickly settle that trifling little
affairb sest morning early, leaving eueebueg shut up with eoeo in our
little bedroomIIfor it seemed that it was some sort of rent or  amadan,
or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with eueebueg and eoeo that
day   eu it was b never could find out, for, though b applied myself
to it several times, b never could master his liturgies and aaaba
rrticlesIIleaving eueebueg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and eoeo
warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, b sallied out among
the shippingb rfter much prolonged sauntering and many random inbuiries,
b learnt that there were three ships up for threeIyears  voyagesIIIhe

hopped over to the IitIbit  and finally, going on board the

looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very
ship for usb

eou may have seen many a buaint craft in your day, for aught b
know IIsbuareItoed luggers  mountainous iapanese eunks  butterIbos
galliots, and what not  but take my word for it, you never saw such a
rare old craft as this same rare old

her old antibuities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining
to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followedb

another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the
principal owners of the

it, all over, with a buaintness both of material and device, unmatched
by anything escept it be IhorkillI ake s carved buckler or bedsteadb ohe

pendants of polished ivoryb ohe was a thing of trophiesb r cannibal of
a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemiesb rll
round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous
eaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for
pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons tob Ihose thews ran not
through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of

there a tiller  and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved

steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Iartar, when he holds
back his fiery steed by clutching its eawb r noble craft, but somehow a
most melancholys rll noble things are touched with thatb

sow when b looked about the buarterIdeck, for some one having authority,
in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first b saw
nobody  but b could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or
rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the mainImastb bt seemed only
a temporary erection used in portb bt was of a conical shape, some ten
feet high  consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken
from the middle and highest part of the eaws of the rightIwhaleb

lanted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced
together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apes united in
a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the
topIknot on some old 
ottowottamie oachem s headb r triangular opening
faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a
complete view forwardb

rnd half concealed in this bueer tenement, b at length found one who
by his aspect seemed to have authority  and who, it being noon, and
the ship s work suspended, was now eneoying respite from the burden of
commandb  e was seated on an oldIfashioned oaken chair, wriggling all
over with curious carving  and the bottom of which was formed of a
stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was
constructedb

Ihere was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of
the elderly man b saw  he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,
and heavily rolled up in blue pilotIcloth, cut in the euaker style 
only there was a fine and almost microscopic netIwork of the minutest
wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from
his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to
windward IIfor this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed
togetherb ouch eyeIwrinkles are very effectual in a scowlb

 bs this the saptain of the 
ebuodn  said b, advancing to the door of
the tentb

b protested my innocence of these thingsb b saw that under the mask
of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated
euakerish santucketer, was full of his insular preeudices, and rather
distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from sape sod or the
iineyardb

b was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at
the hearty grief in his concluding esclamation, but said as calmly as b
could,  uhat you say is no doubt true enough, sir  but how could b know
there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed
b might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accidentb

ror a moment b stood a little puccled by this curious rebuest, not
knowing esactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnestb  ut
concentrating all his crow s feet into one scowl, saptain 
eleg started
me on the errandb

 oing forward and glancing over the weather bow, b perceived that the
ship swinging to her anchor with the floodItide, was now oblibuely
pointing towards the open oceanb Ihe prospect was unlimited, but
esceedingly monotonous and forbidding  not the slightest variety that b
could seeb

 uell, what s the reportn  said 
eleg when b came back   what did ye
seen 

 sot much,  b repliedII nothing but water  considerable horicon though,
and there s a sbuall coming up, b thinkb 

 uell, what does thou think then of seeing the worldn ro ye wish to go
round sape  orn to see any more of it, ehn san t ye see the world where
you standn 

b was a little staggered, but go aIwhaling b must, and b would  and the

ebuod was as good a ship as anyIIb thought the bestIIand all this b now
repeated to 
elegb oeeing me so determined, he espressed his willingness
to ship meb

 rnd thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,  he addedII come
along with yeb  rnd so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabinb

oeated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and
surprising figureb bt turned out to be saptain  ildad, who along with
saptain 
eleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel  the other
shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd
of old annuitants  widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards  each
owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail
or two in the shipb 
eople in santucket invest their money in whaling
vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks
bringing in good interestb

sow,  ildad, like 
eleg, and indeed many other santucketers, was a
euaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect  and to
this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the
peculiarities of the euaker, only variously and anomalously modified
by things altogether alien and heterogeneousb ror some of these same
euakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whaleIhuntersb Ihey
are fighting euakers  they are euakers with a vengeanceb

oo that there are instances among them of men, who, named with ocripture
namesIIa singularly common fashion on the islandIIand in childhood
naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the euaker
idiom  still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure
of their subsebuent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown
peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a
ocandinavian seaIking, or a poetical 
agan  omanb rnd when these things
unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain
and a ponderous heart  who has also by the stillness and seclusion
of many long nightIwatches in the remotest waters, and beneath
constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think
untraditionally and independently  receiving all nature s sweet or
savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding
breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental
advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty languageIIthat man makes
one in a whole nation s censusIIa mighty pageant creature, formed for
noble tragediesb sor will it at all detract from him, dramatically
regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems
a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his natureb ror all
men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidnessb  e sure
of this, e young ambition, all mortal greatness is but diseaseb  ut,
as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with buite another  and
still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another
phase of the euaker, modified by individual circumstancesb

rike saptain 
eleg, saptain  ildad was a wellItoIdo, retired whalemanb
 ut unlike saptain 
elegIIwho cared not a rush for what are called
serious things, and indeed deemed those selfIsame serious things the
veriest of all triflesIIsaptain  ildad had not only been originally
educated according to the strictest sect of santucket euakerism, but all
his subsebuent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island
creatures, round the  ornIIall that had not moved this native born
euaker one single eot, had not so much as altered one angle of his
vestb otill, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of
common consistency about worthy saptain 
elegb Ihough refusing, from
conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself
had illimitably invaded the rtlantic and 
acific  and though a sworn foe
to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straightIbodied coat, spilled tuns
upon tuns of leviathan goreb  ow now in the contemplative evening of his
days, the pious  ildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, b do
not know  but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably
he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man s
religion is one thing, and this practical world buite anotherb Ihis
world pays dividendsb  ising from a little cabinIboy in short clothes
of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shadIbellied waistcoat 
from that becoming boatIheader, chiefImate, and captain, and finally a
ship owner   ildad, as b hinted before, had concluded his adventurous
career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of
sisty, and dedicating his remaining days to the buiet receiving of his
wellIearned incomeb

sow,  ildad, b am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an
incorrigible old hunks, and in his seaIgoing days, a bitter, hard
taskImasterb Ihey told me in santucket, though it certainly seems a
curious story, that when he sailed the old sategut whaleman, his crew,
upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore
eshausted and worn outb ror a pious man, especially for a euaker, he was
certainly rather hardIhearted, to say the leastb  e never used to swear,
though, at his men, they said  but somehow he got an inordinate
buantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of themb uhen  ildad was a
chiefImate, to have his drabIcoloured eye intently looking at you, made
you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch somethingIIa hammer
or a marlingIspike, and go to work like mad, at something or other,
never mind whatb bndolence and idleness perished before himb  is own
person was the esact embodiment of his utilitarian characterb en his
long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard,
his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his
broadIbrimmed hatb

ouch, then, was the person that b saw seated on the transom when b
followed saptain 
eleg down into the cabinb Ihe space between the decks
was small  and there, boltIupright, sat old  ildad, who always sat so,
and never leaned, and this to save his coat tailsb  is broadIbrim was
placed beside him  his legs were stiffly crossed  his drab vesture was
buttoned up to his chin  and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in
reading from a ponderous volumeb

  ildad,  cried saptain 
eleg,  at it again,  ildad, ehn ee have been
studying those ocriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain
knowledgeb  ow far ye got,  ildadn 

rs if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,
 ildad, without noticing his present irreverence, buietly looked up, and
seeing me, glanced again inbuiringly towards 
elegb

  e says he s our man,  ildad,  said 
eleg,  he wants to shipb 

 rost theen  said  ildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to meb

 b dost,  said b unconsciously, he was so intense a euakerb

 uhat do ye think of him,  ildadn  said 
elegb

  e ll do,  said  ildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at
his book in a mumbling tone buite audibleb

b thought him the bueerest old euaker b ever saw, especially as 
eleg,
his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blustererb  ut b said
nothing, only looking round me sharplyb 
eleg now threw open a chest,
and drawing forth the ship s articles, placed pen and ink before him,
and seated himself at a little tableb b began to think it was high time
to settle with myself at what terms b would be willing to engage for the
voyageb b was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no
wages  but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of
the profits called lays, and that these lays were proportioned to the
degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship s
companyb b was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own
lay would not be very large  but considering that b was used to the sea,
could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, b made no doubt that
from all b had heard b should be offered at least the dddth layIIthat
is, the dddth part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever
that might eventually amount tob rnd though the dddth lay was what they
call a rather res  rre, yet it was better than nothing  and if we had a
lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing b would wear out
on it, not to speak of my three years  beef and board, for which b would
not have to pay one stiverb

bt might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely
fortuneIIand so it was, a very poor way indeedb  ut b am one of those
that never take on about princely fortunes, and am buite content if the
world is ready to board and lodge me, while b am putting up at this grim
sign of the Ihunder sloudb bpon the whole, b thought that the dddth lay
would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had b
been offered the dnnth, considering b was of a broadIshouldered makeb

 ut one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about
receiving a generous share of the profits was thisI rshore, b had heard
something of both saptain 
eleg and his unaccountable old crony  ildad 
how that they being the principal proprietors of the 
ebuod, therefore
the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the
whole management of the ship s affairs to these twob rnd b did not know
but what the stingy old  ildad might have a mighty deal to say about
shipping hands, especially as b now found him on board the 
ebuod,
buite at home there in the cabin, and reading his  ible as if at his
own firesideb sow while 
eleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his
eackIknife, old  ildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was
such an interested party in these proceedings   ildad never heeded
us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book,  rre not up for
yourselves treasures upon earth, where mothII 

 uell, saptain  ildad,  interrupted 
eleg,  what d ye say, what lay
shall we give this young mann 

 Ihou knowest best,  was the sepulchral reply,  the seven hundred and
seventyIseventh wouldn t be too much, would itnII where moth and rust do
corrupt, but rreII  

rre, indeed, thought b, and such a lays the seven hundred and
seventyIsevenths uell, old  ildad, you are determined that b, for one,
shall not rre up many rreo here below, where moth and rust do corruptb
bt was an esceedingly res  rre that, indeed  and though from the
magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet
the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and
seventyIseven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make
a IsssI  of it, you will then see, b say, that the seven hundred and
seventyIseventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven
hundred and seventyIseven gold doubloons  and so b thought at the timeb

 uhy, blast your eyes,  ildad,  cried 
eleg,  thou dost not want to
swindle this young mans he must have more than thatb 

 oeven hundred and seventyIseventh,  again said  ildad, without lifting
his eyes  and then went on mumblingII for where your treasure is, there
will your heart be alsob 

 b am going to put him down for the three hundredth,  said 
eleg,  do ye
hear that,  ildads Ihe three hundredth lay, b sayb 

 ildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,
 saptain 
eleg, thou hast a generous heart  but thou must consider the
duty thou owest to the other owners of this shipIIwidows and orphans,
many of themIIand that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this
young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those
orphansb Ihe seven hundred and seventyIseventh lay, saptain 
elegb 

 Ihou  ildads  roared 
eleg, starting up and clattering about the
cabinb   last ye, saptain  ildad, if b had followed thy advice in these
matters, b would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be
heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round sape
 ornb 

 saptain 
eleg,  said  ildad steadily,  thy conscience may be drawing
ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, b can t tell  but as thou art still
an impenitent man, saptain 
eleg, b greatly fear lest thy conscience be
but a leaky one  and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the
fiery pit, saptain 
elegb 

 riery pits fiery pits ye insult me, man  past all natural bearing, ye
insult meb bt s an allIfired outrage to tell any human creature that
he s bound to hellb rlukes and flamess  ildad, say that again to me, and
start my soulIbolts, but b llIIb llIIyes, b ll swallow a live goat with
all his hair and horns onb eut of the cabin, ye canting, drabIcoloured
son of a wooden gunIIa straight wake with yes 

rs he thundered out this he made a rush at  ildad, but with a marvellous
oblibue, sliding celerity,  ildad for that time eluded himb

rlarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and
responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up
all idea of sailing in a vessel so buestionably owned and temporarily
commanded, b stepped aside from the door to give egress to  ildad, who,
b made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened
wrath of 
elegb  ut to my astonishment, he sat down again on the
transom very buietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of
withdrawingb  e seemed buite used to impenitent 
eleg and his waysb rs
for 
eleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more
left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a
little as if still nervously agitatedb  uhews  he whistled at lastII the
sbuall s gone off to leeward, b thinkb  ildad, thou used to be good at
sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will yeb  y eackIknife here needs
the grindstoneb Ihat s he  thank ye,  ildadb sow then, my young man,
bshmael s thy name, didn t ye sayn uell then, down ye go here, bshmael,
for the three hundredth layb 

 saptain 
eleg,  said b,  b have a friend with me who wants to ship
tooIIshall b bring him down toImorrown 

 Io be sure,  said 
elegb  retch him along, and we ll look at himb 

 uhat lay does he wantn  groaned  ildad, glancing up from the book in
which he had again been burying himselfb

 ehs never thee mind about that,  ildad,  said 
elegb   as he ever
whaled it anyn  turning to meb

 nilled more whales than b can count, saptain 
elegb 

 uell, bring him along thenb 

rnd, after signing the papers, off b went  nothing doubting but that b
had done a good morning s work, and that the 
ebuod was the identical
ship that eoeo had provided to carry eueebueg and me round the sapeb

 ut b had not proceeded far, when b began to bethink me that the saptain
with whom b was to sail yet remained unseen by me  though, indeed, in
many cases, a whaleIship will be completely fitted out, and receive all
her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving
to take command  for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the
shore intervals at home so esceedingly brief, that if the captain have
a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble
himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till
all is ready for seab  owever, it is always as well to have a look at
him before irrevocably committing yourself into his handsb Iurning back
b accosted saptain 
eleg, inbuiring where saptain rhab was to be foundb

 rnd what dost thou want of saptain rhabn bt s all right enough  thou
art shippedb 

 ees, but b should like to see himb 

  ut b don t think thou wilt be able to at presentb b don t know esactly

of sick, and yet he don t look sob bn fact, he ain t sick  but no, he

his eye that almost startled meb  rook ye, lad  never say that on board

the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell  but it
was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that
about, as any one might seeb b know, too, that ever since he lost
his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he s been a kind of
moodyIIdesperate moody, and savage sometimes  but that will all pass
offb rnd once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it s
better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad oneb oo

rs b walked away, b was full of thoughtfulness  what had been
incidentally revealed to me of saptain rhab, filled me with a certain
wild vagueness of painfulness concerning himb rnd somehow, at the time,
b felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for b don t know what,
unless it was the cruel loss of his legb rnd yet b also felt a strange
awe of him  but that sort of awe, which b cannot at all describe, was
not esactly awe  b do not know what it wasb  ut b felt it  and it did
not disincline me towards him  though b felt impatience at what seemed
like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me thenb  owever,
my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so that for the
present dark rhab slipped my mindb



s r
Is   db Ihe  amadanb


rs eueebueg s  amadan, or rasting and  umiliation, was to continue all
day, b did not choose to disturb him till towards nightIfall  for b
cherish the greatest respect towards everybody s religious obligations,
never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue
even a congregation of ants worshipping a toadIstool  or those other
creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of footmanism
buite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the torso of
a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate
possessions yet owned and rented in his nameb

b say, we good 
resbyterian shristians should be charitable in these
things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,
pagans and what not, because of their halfIcracy conceits on these
subeectsb Ihere was eueebueg, now, certainly entertaining the most
absurd notions about eoeo and his  amadan IIbut what of thatn eueebueg
thought he knew what he was about, b suppose  he seemed to be content 
and there let him restb rll our arguing with him would not avail  let
him be, b sayI and  eaven have mercy on us allII
resbyterians and 
agans
alikeIIfor we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and
sadly need mendingb

Iowards evening, when b felt assured that all his performances and
rituals must be over, b went up to his room and knocked at the door  but
no answerb b tried to open it, but it was fastened insideb  eueebueg, 
said b softly through the keyIholeIIIall silentb  b say, eueebuegs why

began to grow alarmedb b had allowed him such abundant time  b thought
he might have had an apoplectic fitb b looked through the keyIhole  but
the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the keyIhole prospect
was but a crooked and sinister oneb b could only see part of the
footIboard of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing moreb b
was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of
eueebueg s harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous had taken
from him, before our mounting to the chamberb Ihat s strange, thought b 
but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or
never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside here, and no
possible mistakeb

little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing
b should not break down her premises  but b tore from her, and with a
sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the markb

uith a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming
against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling  and there, good
heavenss there sat eueebueg, altogether cool and selfIcollected  right
in the middle of the room  sbuatting on his hams, and holding eoeo on
top of his headb  e looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat
like a carved image with scarce a sign of active lifeb

 eueebueg,  said b, going up to him,  eueebueg, what s the matter with
youn 

  e hain t been a sittin  so all day, has hen  said the landladyb

 ut all we said, not a word could we drag out of him  b almost felt
like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost
intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained 
especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of
eight or ten hours, going too without his regular mealsb

  rsb  ussey,  said b,  he s rrbis at all events  so leave us, if you
please, and b will see to this strange affair myselfb 

slosing the door upon the landlady, b endeavored to prevail upon
eueebueg to take a chair  but in vainb Ihere he sat  and all he could
doIIfor all my polite arts and blandishmentsIIhe would not move a peg,
nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in
the slightest wayb

b wonder, thought b, if this can possibly be a part of his  amadan  do
they fast on their hams that way in his native islandb bt must be so 
yes, it s part of his creed, b suppose  well, then, let him rest  he ll
get up sooner or later, no doubtb bt can t last for ever, thank  od,
and his  amadan only comes once a year  and b don t believe it s very
punctual thenb

b went down to supperb rfter sitting a long time listening to the long
stories of some sailors who had eust come from a plumIpudding voyage, as
they called it ithat is, a short whalingIvoyage in a schooner or brig,
confined to the north of the line, in the rtlantic ecean onlyi  after
listening to these plumIpuddingers till nearly eleven o clock, b went
up stairs to go to bed, feeling buite sure by this time eueebueg must
certainly have brought his  amadan to a terminationb  ut no  there he
was eust where b had left him  he had not stirred an inchb b began to
grow vesed with him  it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be
sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,
holding a piece of wood on his headb

 ror heaven s sake, eueebueg, get up and shake yourself  get up and have
some supperb eou ll starve  you ll kill yourself, eueebuegb   ut not a
word did he replyb

respairing of him, therefore, b determined to go to bed and to sleep 
and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow meb  ut previous to
turning in, b took my heavy bearskin eacket, and threw it over him, as
it promised to be a very cold night  and he had nothing but his ordinary
round eacket onb ror some time, do all b would, b could not get into
the faintest doceb b had blown out the candle  and the mere thought
of eueebuegIInot four feet offIIsitting there in that uneasy position,
stark alone in the cold and dark  this made me really wretchedb Ihink of
it  sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his
hams in this dreary, unaccountable  amadans

 ut somehow b dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of
day  when, looking over the bedside, there sbuatted eueebueg, as if he
had been screwed down to the floorb  ut as soon as the first glimpse of
sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating eoints,
but with a cheerful look  limped towards me where b lay  pressed his
forehead again against mine  and said his  amadan was overb

sow, as b before hinted, b have no obeection to any person s religion,
be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any
other person, because that other person don t believe it alsob  ut when
a man s religion becomes really frantic  when it is a positive torment
to him  and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to
lodge in  then b think it high time to take that individual aside and
argue the point with himb

rnd eust so b now did with eueebuegb  eueebueg,  said b,  get into bed
now, and lie and listen to meb  b then went on, beginning with the rise
and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various
religions of the present time, during which time b labored to show
eueebueg that all these rents,  amadans, and prolonged hamIsbuattings in
cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense  bad for the health  useless
for the soul  opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of  ygiene and
common senseb b told him, too, that he being in other things such an
estremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained
me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous  amadan
of hisb  esides, argued b, fasting makes the body cave in  hence the
spirit caves in  and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be
halfIstarvedb Ihis is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish
such melancholy notions about their hereaftersb bn one word, eueebueg,
said b, rather digressively  hell is an idea first born on an undigested
appleIdumpling  and since then perpetuated through the hereditary
dyspepsias nurtured by  amadansb

b then asked eueebueg whether he himself was ever troubled with
dyspepsia  espressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it
inb  e said no  only upon one memorable occasionb bt was after a great
feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle
wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o clock in the
afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very eveningb

 so more, eueebueg,  said b, shuddering   that will do   for b knew the
inferences without his further hinting themb b had seen a sailor who had
visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when
a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the
yard or garden of the victor  and then, one by one, they were placed
in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with
breadfruit and cocoanuts  and with some parsley in their mouths, were
sent round with the victor s compliments to all his friends, eust as
though these presents were so many shristmas turkeysb

rfter all, b do not think that my remarks about religion made much
impression upon eueebuegb  ecause, in the first place, he somehow seemed
dull of hearing on that important subeect, unless considered from his
own point of view  and, in the second place, he did not more than one
third understand me, couch my ideas simply as b would  and, finally, he
no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than
b didb  e looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and
compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible
young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan pietyb

rt last we rose and dressed  and eueebueg, taking a prodigiously hearty
breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not
make much profit by reason of his  amadan, we sallied out to board the

ebuod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bonesb



s r
Is    b  is  arkb


rs we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, eueebueg
carrying his harpoon, saptain 
eleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us
from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal,
and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft,
unless they previously produced their papersb

 uhat do you mean by that, saptain 
elegn  said b, now eumping on the
bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharfb

 b mean,  he replied,  he must show his papersb 

 ees,  said saptain  ildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from
behind 
eleg s, out of the wigwamb   e must show that he s convertedb
oon of darkness,  he added, turning to eueebueg,  art thou at present in
communion with any shristian churchn 

 uhy,  said b,  he s a member of the first songregational shurchb   ere
be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in santucket ships at
last come to be converted into the churchesb

 rirst songregational shurch,  cried  ildad,  whats that worships in
reacon reuteronomy soleman s meetingIhousen  and so saying, taking
out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana
handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the
wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at
eueebuegb

  ow long hath he been a membern  he then said, turning to me   not very
long, b rather guess, young manb 

 so,  said 
eleg,  and he hasn t been bapticed right either, or it would
have washed some of that devil s blue off his faceb 

 ro tell, now,  cried  ildad,  is this 
hilistine a regular member of
reacon reuteronomy s meetingn b never saw him going there, and b pass it
every rord s dayb 

 b don t know anything about reacon reuteronomy or his meeting,  said
b   all b know is, that eueebueg here is a born member of the rirst
songregational shurchb  e is a deacon himself, eueebueg isb 

 eoung man,  said  ildad sternly,  thou art skylarking with meIIesplain
thyself, thou young  ittiteb uhat church dost thee meann answer meb 

rinding myself thus hard pushed, b repliedb  b mean, sir, the same
ancient satholic shurch to which you and b, and saptain 
eleg there,
and eueebueg here, and all of us, and every mother s son and soul of
us belong  the great and everlasting rirst songregation of this whole
worshipping world  we all belong to that  only some of us cherish some
bueer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief  in I rI we all eoin

eleg, drawing nearerb  eoung
man, you d better ship for a missionary, instead of a foreImast hand

that you call himn tell euohog to step alongb  y the great anchor, what
a harpoon he s got theres looks like good stuff that  and he handles it
about rightb b say, euohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand
in the head of a whaleIboatn did you ever strike a fishn 

uithout saying a word, eueebueg, in his wild sort of way, eumped upon
the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whaleIboats
hanging to the side  and then bracing his left knee, and poising his
harpoon, cried out in some such way as thisIII

 sap ain, you see him small drop tar on water deren eou see himn well,
spose him one whale eye, well, dens  and taking sharp aim at it, he
darted the iron right over old  ildad s broad brim, clean across the
ship s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sightb

 sow,  said eueebueg, buietly hauling in the line,  sposIee him whaleIe
eye  why, dad whale deadb 

 euick,  ildad,  said 
eleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangwayb
 euick, b say, you  ildad, and get the ship s papersb ue must have
 edgehog there, b mean euohog, in one of our boatsb rook ye, euohog,
we ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that s more than ever was given a
harpooneer yet out of santucketb 

oo down we went into the cabin, and to my great eoy eueebueg was soon
enrolled among the same ship s company to which b myself belongedb

uhen all preliminaries were over and 
eleg had got everything ready for
signing, he turned to me and said,  b guess, euohog there don t know how
to write, does hen b say, euohog, blast yes dost thou sign thy name or
make thy markn 

 ut at this buestion, eueebueg, who had twice or thrice before taken
part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed  but taking the
offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an esact
counterpart of a bueer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm  so
that through saptain 
eleg s obstinate mistake touching his appellative,
it stood something like thisIII

euohogb his a markb

 eanwhile saptain  ildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing eueebueg,
and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his
broadIskirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting
one entitled  Ihe ratter ray soming  or so Iime to rose,  placed it in
eueebueg s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,
looked earnestly into his eyes, and said,  oon of darkness, b must do my
duty by thee  b am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for the
souls of all its crew  if thou still clingest to thy 
agan ways, which b
sadly fear, b beseech thee, remain not for aye a  elial bondsmanb opurn

oomething of the salt sea yet lingered in old  ildad s language,
heterogeneously mised with ocriptural and domestic phrasesb

cried 
elegb  
ious harpooneers never make good voyagersIIit takes the shark

Ihere was young sat owaine, once the bravest boatIheader out of all

sheered away from whales, for fear of afterIclaps, in case he got stove
and went to ravy ionesb

it is to have the fear of death  how, then, can st thou prate in this
ungodly guiseb Ihou beliest thine own heart,

 ildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck,
where we followed himb Ihere he stood, very buietly overlooking some
sailmakers who were mending a topIsail in the waistb sow and then
he stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which
otherwise might have been wastedb

 ohipmates, have ye shipped in that shipn 

eueebueg and b had eust left the 
ebuod, and were sauntering away from
the water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when
the above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,
levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in buestionb  e was but
shabbily apparelled in faded eacket and patched trowsers  a rag of a
black handkerchief investing his neckb r confluent smallIpos had in all
directions flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated ribbed
bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried upb

more time for an uninterrupted look at himb

 slieahb 

slieahs thought b, and we walked away, both commenting, after each
other s fashion, upon this ragged old sailor  and agreed that he was
nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbearb  ut we had not gone
perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and
looking back as b did so, who should be seen but slieah following us,
though at a distanceb oomehow, the sight of him struck me so, that b
said nothing to eueebueg of his being behind, but passed on with my
comrade, ansious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner
that we didb  e did  and then it seemed to me that he was dogging
us, but with what intent b could not for the life of me imagineb Ihis
circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, halfIhinting, halfIrevealing,
shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments
and halfIapprehensions, and all connected with the 
ebuod  and saptain
rhab  and the leg he had lost  and the sape  orn fit  and the silver
calabash  and what saptain 
eleg had said of him, when b left the ship
the day previous  and the prediction of the sbuaw Iistig  and the voyage
we had bound ourselves to sail  and a hundred other shadowy thingsb

b was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged slieah was really
dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with eueebueg,
and on that side of it retraced our stepsb  ut slieah passed on, without
seeming to notice usb Ihis relieved me  and once more, and finally as it
seemed to me, b pronounced him in my heart, a humbugb



s r
Is  dnb rll rstirb


r day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the 
ebuodb
sot only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on
board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging  in short, everything
betokened that the ship s preparations were hurrying to a closeb saptain

eleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp
lookIout upon the handsI  ildad did all the purchasing and providing
at the stores  and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were
working till long after nightIfallb

en the day following eueebueg s signing the articles, word was given at
all the inns where the ship s company were stopping, that their chests
must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon
the vessel might be sailingb oo eueebueg and b got down our traps,
resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the lastb  ut it seems they
always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail
for several daysb  ut no wonder  there was a good deal to be done, and
there is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the 
ebuod
was fully ebuippedb

svery one knows what a multitude of thingsIIbeds, sauceIpans, knives
and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nutIcrackers, and what not, are
indispensable to the business of housekeepingb iust so with whaling,
which necessitates a threeIyears  housekeeping upon the wide ocean,
far from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankersb rnd
though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means
to the same estent as with whalemenb ror besides the great length of the
whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the
fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors
usually frebuented, it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling
vessels are the most esposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially
to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of
the voyage most dependsb  ence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare
lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but a spare saptain
and duplicate shipb

rt the period of our arrival at the bsland, the heaviest storage of the

ebuod had been almost completed  comprising her beef, bread, water,
fuel, and iron hoops and stavesb  ut, as before hinted, for some time
there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and
ends of things, both large and smallb

shief among those who did this fetching and carrying was saptain
 ildad s sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable
spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if o s
could help it, nothing should be found wanting in the 
ebuod, after once
fairly getting to seab rt one time she would come on board with a ear
of pickles for the steward s pantry  another time with a bunch of buills
for the chief mate s desk, where he kept his log  a third time with a
roll of flannel for the small of some one s rheumatic backb sever did
any woman better deserve her name, which was sharityIIrunt sharity, as
everybody called herb rnd like a sister of charity did this charitable
runt sharity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn her hand
and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort, and
consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother
 ildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of
wellIsaved dollarsb

 ut it was startling to see this escellent hearted euakeress coming on
board, as she did the last day, with a long oilIladle in one hand, and
a still longer whaling lance in the otherb sor was  ildad himself nor
saptain 
eleg at all backwardb rs for  ildad, he carried about with him
a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down
went his mark opposite that article upon the paperb svery once in a
while 
eleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men
down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mastIhead, and then
concluded by roaring back into his wigwamb

ruring these days of preparation, eueebueg and b often visited the
craft, and as often b asked about saptain rhab, and how he was, and when
he was going to come on board his shipb Io these buestions they would
answer, that he was getting better and better, and was espected aboard
every day  meantime, the two captains, 
eleg and  ildad, could attend
to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyageb bf b had been
downright honest with myself, b would have seen very plainly in my heart
that b did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage,
without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute
dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open seab
 ut when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be
already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his
suspicions even from himselfb rnd much this way it was with meb b said
nothing, and tried to think nothingb

rt last it was given out that some time nest day the ship would
certainly sailb oo nest morning, eueebueg and b took a very early startb



s r
Is  d b  oing rboardb


bt was nearly sis o clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we
drew nigh the wharfb

 Ihere are some sailors running ahead there, if b see right,  said b to
eueebueg,  it can t be shadows  she s off by sunrise, b guess  come ons 

 rvasts  cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind
us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself
between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight,
strangely peering from eueebueg to meb bt was slieahb

  oing aboardn

 rin t going aboard, thenn 

 ees, we are,  said b,  but what business is that of yoursn ro you know,
 rb slieah, that b consider you a little impertinentn 

 so, no, no  b wasn t aware of that,  said slieah, slowly and
wonderingly looking from me to eueebueg, with the most unaccountable
glancesb

 slieah,  said b,  you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawingb ue
are going to the bndian and 
acific eceans, and would prefer not to be
detainedb 

 ee be, be yen soming back afore breakfastn 

  e s cracked, eueebueg,  said b,  come onb 

  olloas  cried stationary slieah, hailing us when we had removed a few
pacesb

 sever mind him,  said b,  eueebueg, come onb 

 ut he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my
shoulder, saidII rid ye see anything looking like men going towards that
ship a while agon 

otruck by this plain matterIofIfact buestion, b answered, saying,  ees,
b thought b did see four or five men  but it was too dim to be sureb 

 iery dim, very dim,  said slieahb   orning to yeb 

ence more we buitted him  but once more he came softly after us  and
touching my shoulder again, said,  oee if you can find  em now, will yen

yeb ohan t see ye again very soon, b guess  unless it s before the  rand
iuryb  rnd with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving me, for
the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudenceb

rt last, stepping on board the 
ebuod, we found everything in profound
buiet, not a soul movingb Ihe cabin entrance was locked within  the
hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of riggingb  oing forward
to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle openb oeeing a
light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a
tattered peaIeacketb  e was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his
face downwards and inclosed in his folded armsb Ihe profoundest slumber
slept upon himb

 Ihose sailors we saw, eueebueg, where can they have gone ton  said b,
looking dubiously at the sleeperb  ut it seemed that, when on the wharf,
eueebueg had not at all noticed what b now alluded to  hence b would
have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter,
were it not for slieah s otherwise inesplicable buestionb  ut b beat the
thing down  and again marking the sleeper, eocularly hinted to eueebueg
that perhaps we had best sit up with the body  telling him to establish
himself accordinglyb  e put his hand upon the sleeper s rear, as though
feeling if it was soft enough  and then, without more ado, sat buietly
down thereb

  raciouss eueebueg, don t sit there,  said bb

 ehs perry dood seat,  said eueebueg,  my country way  won t hurt him

but how hard he breathes, he s heaving himself  get off, eueebueg, you
are heavy, it s grinding the face of the poorb  et off, eueebuegs rook,
he ll twitch you off soonb b wonder he don t wakeb 

eueebueg removed himself to eust beyond the head of the sleeper, and
lighted his tomahawk pipeb b sat at the feetb ue kept the pipe passing
over the sleeper, from one to the otherb  eanwhile, upon buestioning him
in his broken fashion, eueebueg gave me to understand that, in his
land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,
chiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening some
of the lower orders for ottomans  and to furnish a house comfortably in
that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lacy fellows, and lay
them round in the piers and alcovesb  esides, it was very convenient on
an escursion  much better than those gardenIchairs which are convertible
into walkingIsticks  upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and
desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps
in some damp marshy placeb

uhile narrating these things, every time eueebueg received the tomahawk
from me, he flourished the hatchetIside of it over the sleeper s headb

 uhat s that for, eueebuegn

to tell upon himb  e breathed with a sort of muffledness  then seemed

saying he went on deck, and we followedb

bt was now clear sunriseb ooon the crew came on board in twos and

engaged  and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various
last things on boardb  eanwhile saptain rhab remained invisibly
enshrined within his cabinb

Is  ddb  erry shristmasb


rt length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship s riggers,
and after the 
ebuod had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the
everIthoughtful sharity had come off in a whaleIboat, with her last
giftIIa nightIcap for otubb, the second mate, her brotherIinIlaw, and a
spare  ible for the stewardIIafter all this, the two saptains, 
eleg
and  ildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to the chief mate, 
eleg
saidI

 sow,  rb otarbuck, are you sure everything is rightn saptain rhab is
all readyIIeust spoke to himIInothing more to be got from shore, ehn
uell, call all hands, thenb  uster  em aft hereIIblast  ems 

 so need of profane words, however great the hurry, 
eleg,  said  ildad,
 but away with thee, friend otarbuck, and do our biddingb 

 ow nows  ere upon the very point of starting for the voyage, saptain

eleg and saptain  ildad were going it with a high hand on the
buarterIdeck, eust as if they were to be eointIcommanders at sea, as
well as to all appearances in portb rnd, as for saptain rhab, no sign of
him was yet to be seen  only, they said he was in the cabinb  ut then,
the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the
ship under weigh, and steering her well out to seab bndeed, as that was
not at all his proper business, but the pilot s  and as he was not
yet completely recoveredIIso they saidIItherefore, saptain rhab stayed
belowb rnd all this seemed natural enough  especially as in the merchant
service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable
time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table,
having a farewell merryImaking with their shore friends, before they
buit the ship for good with the pilotb

 ut there was not much chance to think over the matter, for saptain

eleg was now all aliveb  e seemed to do most of the talking and
commanding, and not  ildadb

 rft here, ye sons of bachelors,  he cried, as the sailors lingered at
the mainImastb   rb otarbuck, drive em aftb 

 otrike the tent theres IIwas the nest orderb rs b hinted before, this
whalebone marbuee was never pitched escept in port  and on board the

ebuod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to
be the nest thing to heaving up the anchorb

  an the capstans  lood and thundersIIeumps IIwas the nest command, and
the crew sprang for the handspikesb

sow in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot
is the forward part of the shipb rnd here  ildad, who, with 
eleg, be it
known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots
of the portIIhe being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in
order to save the santucket pilotIfee to all the ships he was concerned
in, for he never piloted any other craftII ildad, b say, might now
be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching
anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody,
to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of
a chorus about the girls in  ooble rlley, with hearty good willb
severtheless, not three days previous,  ildad had told them that no
profane songs would be allowed on board the 
ebuod, particularly in
getting under weigh  and sharity, his sister, had placed a small choice
copy of uatts in each seaman s berthb

 eantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, saptain 
eleg ripped
and swore astern in the most frightful mannerb b almost thought he would
sink the ship before the anchor could be got up  involuntarily b paused
on my handspike, and told eueebueg to do the same, thinking of the
perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a
pilotb b was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious
 ildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred and
seventyIseventh lay  when b felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and
turning round, was horrified at the apparition of saptain 
eleg in the
act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinityb Ihat was my first
kickb

 bs that the way they heave in the marchant servicen  he roaredb
 opring, thou sheepIhead  spring, and break thy backbones uhy don t ye
spring, b say, all of yeIIsprings euohogs spring, thou chap with the red
whiskers  spring there, ocotchIcap  spring, thou green pantsb opring, b
say, all of ye, and spring your eyes outs  rnd so saying, he moved
along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while
imperturbable  ildad kept leading off with his psalmodyb Ihinks b,
saptain 
eleg must have been drinking something toIdayb

rt last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glidedb bt
was a short, cold shristmas  and as the short northern day merged into
night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose
freecing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armorb Ihe long rows of
teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight  and like the white
ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from
the bowsb

rank  ildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the
old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost
all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady
notes were heard,II

 oweet fields beyond the swelling flood, otand dressed in living greenb
oo to the iews old sanaan stood, uhile iordan rolled betweenb 


sever did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than thenb Ihey
were full of hope and fruitionb opite of this frigid winter night in the
boisterous rtlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter eacket, there was
yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store  and meads
and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the spring,
untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummerb

rt last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed
no longerb Ihe stout sailIboat that had accompanied us began ranging
alongsideb

bt was curious and not unpleasing, how 
eleg and  ildad were affected at
this euncture, especially saptain  ildadb ror loath to depart, yet 
very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a
voyageIIbeyond both stormy sapes  a ship in which some thousands of
his hard earned dollars were invested  a ship, in which an old shipmate
sailed as captain  a man almost as old as he, once more starting to
encounter all the terrors of the pitiless eaw  loath to say goodIbye to
a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him,IIpoor old  ildad
lingered long  paced the deck with ansious strides  ran down into the
cabin to speak another farewell word there  again came on deck, and
looked to windward  looked towards the wide and endless waters, only
bounded by the farIoff unseen sastern sontinents  looked towards
the land  looked aloft  looked right and left  looked everywhere
and nowhere  and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin,
convulsively grasped stout 
eleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern,
for a moment stood gacing heroically in his face, as much as to say,
 severtheless, friend 
eleg, b can stand it  yes, b canb 

rs for 
eleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher  but for all
his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern
came too nearb rnd he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deckIInow

s r
Is  d b Ihe rdvocateb


rs eueebueg and b are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling 
and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among
landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit  therefore, b
am all ansiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the ineustice hereby done
to us hunters of whalesb

bn the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish
the fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not
accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professionsb bf a
stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society,
it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were
he presented to the company as a harpooneer, say  and if in emulation
of the naval officers he should append the initials obubrb ioperm
uhale risheryi to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed
preIeminently presuming and ridiculousb

roubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us
whalemen, is thisI they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a
butchering sort of business  and that when actively engaged therein, we
are surrounded by all manner of defilementsb  utchers we are, that is
trueb  ut butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been
all  artial sommanders whom the world invariably delights to honourb rnd
as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye shall
soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown,
and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whaleIship
at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earthb  ut even
granting the charge in buestion to be true  what disordered slippery
decks of a whaleIship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those
battleIfields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies 
plauditsn rnd if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit
of the soldier s profession  let me assure ye that many a veteran
who has freely marched up to a battery, would buickly recoil at the
apparition of the sperm whale s vast tail, fanning into eddies the air
over his headb ror what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared
with the interlinked terrors and wonders of  ods

 ut, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it
unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage  yea, an allIabounding
adorations for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn round
the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glorys

 ut look at this matter in other lights  weigh it in all sorts of
scales  see what we whalemen are, and have beenb

uhy did the rutch in re uitt s time have admirals of their whaling
fleetsn uhy did rouis aibb of rrance, at his own personal espense, fit
out whaling ships from runkirk, and politely invite to that town some
score or two of families from our own island of santucketn uhy did
 ritain between the years  ddn and  d   pay to her whalemen in bounties
upwards of r ,nnn,nnnn rnd lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of
rmerica now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world 
sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels  manned by eighteen
thousand men  yearly consuming  ,nnn,nnn of dollars  the ships worth,
at the time of sailing, hdn,nnn,nnns and every year importing into our
harbors a well reaped harvest of hd,nnn,nnnb  ow comes all this, if
there be not something puissant in whalingn

 ut this is not the half  look againb

b freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life,
point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sisty
years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in
one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whalingb ene way
and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so
continuously momentous in their sebuential issues, that whaling may
well be regarded as that sgyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves
pregnant from her wombb bt would be a hopeless, endless task to
catalogue all these thingsb ret a handful sufficeb ror many years past
the whaleIship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and
least known parts of the earthb ohe has esplored seas and archipelagoes
which had no chart, where no sook or iancouver had ever sailedb bf
rmerican and suropean menIofIwar now peacefully ride in once savage
harbors, let them fire salutes to the honour and glory of the
whaleIship, which originally showed them the way, and first interpreted
between them and the savagesb Ihey may celebrate as they will the heroes
of ssploring sspeditions, your sooks, your nrusensterns  but b say that
scores of anonymous saptains have sailed out of santucket, that were
as great, and greater than your sook and your nrusensternb ror in their
succourless emptyIhandedness, they, in the heathenish sharked waters,
and by the beaches of unrecorded, eavelin islands, battled with virgin
wonders and terrors that sook with all his marines and muskets would
not willingly have daredb rll that is made such a flourish of in the old
oouth oea ioyages, those things were but the lifeItime commonplaces of
our heroic santucketersb eften, adventures which iancouver dedicates
three chapters to, these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the
ship s common logb rh, the worlds eh, the worlds

bntil the whale fishery rounded sape  orn, no commerce but colonial,
scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between surope and
the long line of the opulent opanish provinces on the 
acific coastb
bt was the whaleman who first broke through the eealous policy of the
opanish crown, touching those colonies  and, if space permitted, it
might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the
liberation of 
eru, shili, and  olivia from the yoke of eld opain, and
the establishment of the eternal democracy in those partsb

Ihat great rmerica on the other side of the sphere, rustralia, was given
to the enlightened world by the whalemanb rfter its first blunderIborn
discovery by a rutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores
as pestiferously barbarous  but the whaleIship touched thereb Ihe
whaleIship is the true mother of that now mighty colonyb  oreover,
in the infancy of the first rustralian settlement, the emigrants were
several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the
whaleIship luckily dropping an anchor in their watersb Ihe uncounted
isles of all 
olynesia confess the same truth, and do commercial homage
to the whaleIship, that cleared the way for the missionary and the
merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their
first destinationsb bf that doubleIbolted land, iapan, is ever to become
hospitable, it is the whaleIship alone to whom the credit will be due 
for already she is on the thresholdb

 ut if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no
aesthetically noble associations connected with it, then am b ready to
shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet
every timeb

Ihe whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you
will sayb

glowing eulogy in

Ihe chief mate of the 
ebuod was otarbuck, a native of santucket, and a
euaker by descentb  e was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy
coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard
as twiceIbaked biscuitb Iransported to the bndies, his live blood would
not spoil like bottled aleb  e must have been born in some time of
general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which
his state is famousb enly some thirty arid summers had he seen  those
summers had dried up all his physical superfluousnessb  ut this, his
thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting ansieties and
cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blightb bt was merely
the condensation of the manb  e was by no means illIlooking  buite the
contraryb  is pure tight skin was an escellent fit  and closely wrapped
up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified
sgyptian, this otarbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come,
and to endure always, as now  for be it 
olar snow or torrid sun, like
a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted to do well
in all climatesb rooking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet
lingering images of those thousandIfold perils he had calmly confronted
through lifeb r staid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a
telling pantomime of action, and not a tame chapter of soundsb eet, for
all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there were certain bualities
in him which at times affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to
overbalance all the restb bncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and
endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his
life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition  but to that
sort of superstition, which in some organications seems rather to
spring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignoranceb eutward portents
and inward presentiments were hisb rnd if at times these things bent the
welded iron of his soul, much more did his farIaway domestic memories
of his young sape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from the
original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those
latent influences which, in some honestIhearted men, restrain the gush
of dareIdevil daring, so often evinced by others in the more perilous
vicissitudes of the fisheryb  b will have no man in my boat,  said
otarbuck,  who is not afraid of a whaleb   y this, he seemed to mean,
not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises
from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an utterly
fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a cowardb

 rye, aye,  said otubb, the second mate,  otarbuck, there, is as careful
a man as you ll find anywhere in this fisheryb   ut we shall ere long
see what that word  careful  precisely means when used by a man like
otubb, or almost any other whale hunterb

otarbuck was no crusader after perils  in him courage was not a
sentiment  but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all
mortally practical occasionsb  esides, he thought, perhaps, that in this
business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits of
the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wastedb
uherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sunIdown  nor
for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting
himb ror, thought otarbuck, b am here in this critical ocean to kill
whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for theirs  and that
hundreds of men had been so killed otarbuck well knewb uhat doom was
his own father sn uhere, in the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn
limbs of his brothern

uith memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain
superstitiousness, as has been said  the courage of this otarbuck which
could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been estremeb  ut
it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organiced, and with such
terrible esperiences and remembrances as he had  it was not in nature
that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in
him, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its
confinement, and burn all his courage upb rnd brave as he might be, it
was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which,
while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or
whales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet
cannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors,
which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and
mighty manb

 ut were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete
abasement of poor otarbuck s fortitude, scarce might b have the heart to
write it  for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to espose
the fall of valour in the soulb  en may seem detestable as eoint
stockIcompanies and nations  knaves, fools, and murderers there may be 
men may have mean and meagre faces  but man, in the ideal, is so noble
and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any
ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their
costliest robesb Ihat immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves,
so far within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character
seem gone  bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of
a valorIruined manb sor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight,
completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting starsb  ut this
august dignity b treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes, but
that abounding dignity which has no robed investitureb Ihou shalt see it
shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike  that democratic
dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from  od   imselfs Ihe
great  od absolutes Ihe centre and circumference of all democracys  is
omnipresence, our divine ebualitys

otubb was the second mateb  e was a native of sape sod  and hence,
according to local usage, was called a sapeIsodImanb r happyIgoIlucky 
neither craven nor valiant  taking perils as they came with an
indifferent air  and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the
chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a eourneyman eoiner engaged
for the yearb  oodIhumored, easy, and careless, he presided over his
whaleIboat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his
crew all invited guestsb  e was as particular about the comfortable
arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stageIdriver is about the
snugness of his bosb uhen close to the whale, in the very deathIlock of
the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and offIhandedly, as
a whistling tinker his hammerb  e would hum over his old rigadig tunes
while flank and flank with the most esasperated monsterb rong usage had,
for this otubb, converted the eaws of death into an easy chairb uhat he
thought of death itself, there is no tellingb uhether he ever thought of
it at all, might be a buestion  but, if he ever did chance to cast his
mind that way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor,
he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir
themselves there, about something which he would find out when he obeyed
the order, and not soonerb

uhat, perhaps, with other things, made otubb such an easyIgoing,
unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a
world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs 
what helped to bring about that almost impious goodIhumor of his  that
thing must have been his pipeb ror, like his nose, his short, black
little pipe was one of the regular features of his faceb eou would
almost as soon have espected him to turn out of his bunk without his
nose as without his pipeb  e kept a whole row of pipes there ready
loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand  and, whenever he
turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from
the other to the end of the chapter  then loading them again to be in
readiness anewb ror, when otubb dressed, instead of first putting his
legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouthb

b say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his
peculiar disposition  for every one knows that this earthly air, whether
ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of
the numberless mortals who have died eshaling it  and as in time of the
cholera, some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their
mouths  so, likewise, against all mortal tribulations, otubb s tobacco
smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agentb

Ihe third mate was rlask, a native of Iisbury, in  artha s iineyardb r
short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,
who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally
and hereditarily affronted him  and therefore it was a sort of point of
honour with him, to destroy them whenever encounteredb oo utterly lost
was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their maeestic
bulk and mystic ways  and so dead to anything like an apprehension of
any possible danger from encountering them  that in his poor opinion,
the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least
waterIrat, rebuiring only a little circumvention and some small
application of time and trouble in order to kill and boilb Ihis
ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in
the matter of whales  he followed these fish for the fun of it  and a
three years  voyage round sape  orn was only a eolly eoke that lasted
that length of timeb rs a carpenter s nails are divided into wrought
nails and cut nails  so mankind may be similarly dividedb rittle rlask
was one of the wrought ones  made to clinch tight and last longb Ihey
called him ningI
ost on board of the 
ebuod  because, in form, he could
be well likened to the short, sbuare timber known by that name in rrctic
whalers  and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted
into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those
battering seasb

sow these three matesIIotarbuck, otubb, and rlask, were momentous
menb Ihey it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the

ebuod s boats as headsmenb bn that grand order of battle in which
saptain rhab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales,
these three headsmen were as captains of companiesb er, being armed with
their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers 
even as the harpooneers were flingers of eavelinsb

rnd since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a  othic
nnight of old, is always accompanied by his boatIsteerer or harpooneer,
who in certain coneunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when
the former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault  and
moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy
and friendliness  it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set
down who the 
ebuod s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of
them belongedb

rirst of all was eueebueg, whom otarbuck, the chief mate, had selected
for his sbuireb  ut eueebueg is already knownb

sest was Iashtego, an unmised bndian from  ay  ead, the most westerly
promontory of  artha s iineyard, where there still esists the last
remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the neighboring
island of santucket with many of her most daring harpooneersb bn the
fishery, they usually go by the generic name of  ayI eadersb Iashtego s
long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones, and black rounding
eyesIIfor an bndian, eriental in their largeness, but rntarctic in their
glittering espressionIIall this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor
of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in buest
of the great sew sngland moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal
forests of the mainb  ut no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild
beasts of the woodland, Iashtego now hunted in the wake of the great
whales of the sea  the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the
infallible arrow of the siresb Io look at the tawny brawn of his lithe
snaky limbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of
the earlier 
uritans, and halfIbelieved this wild bndian to be a son
of the 
rince of the 
owers of the rirb Iashtego was otubb the second
mate s sbuireb

Ihird among the harpooneers was raggoo, a gigantic, coalIblack
negroIsavage, with a lionIlike treadIIan rhasuerus to beholdb ouspended
from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called
them ringIbolts, and would talk of securing the topIsail halyards to
themb bn his youth raggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,
lying in a lonely bay on his native coastb rnd never having been
anywhere in the world but in rfrica, santucket, and the pagan harbors
most frebuented by whalemen  and having now led for many years the bold
life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what
manner of men they shipped  raggoo retained all his barbaric virtues,
and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of sis
feet five in his socksb Ihere was a corporeal humility in looking up at
him  and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to
beg truce of a fortressb surious to tell, this imperial negro, rhasuerus
raggoo, was the obuire of little rlask, who looked like a chessIman
beside himb rs for the residue of the 
ebuod s company, be it said, that
at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the
mast employed in the rmerican whale fishery, are rmericans born, though
pretty nearly all the officers areb  erein it is the same with the
rmerican whale fishery as with the rmerican army and military and
merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the construction
of the rmerican sanals and  ailroadsb Ihe same, b say, because in all
these cases the native rmerican liberally provides the brains, the rest
of the world as generously supplying the musclesb so small number of
these whaling seamen belong to the rcores, where the outward bound
santucket whalers frebuently touch to augment their crews from the hardy
peasants of those rocky shoresb bn like manner, the  reenland whalers
sailing out of  ull or rondon, put in at the ohetland bslands, to
receive the full complement of their crewb bpon the passage homewards,
they drop them there againb  ow it is, there is no telling, but
bslanders seem to make the best whalemenb Ihey were nearly all bslanders
in the 
ebuod, boerrIeso too, b call such, not acknowledging the common
continent of men, but each boerrIe living on a separate continent of his
ownb eet now, federated along one keel, what a set these bsolatoes weres

Is  d b rhabb


ror several days after leaving santucket, nothing above hatches was seen
of saptain rhabb Ihe mates regularly relieved each other at the watches,
and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the
only commanders of the ship  only they sometimes issued from the cabin
with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was plain they
but commanded vicariouslyb ees, their supreme lord and dictator was
there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate
into the now sacred retreat of the cabinb

svery time b ascended to the deck from my watches below, b instantly
gaced aft to mark if any strange face were visible  for my first vague
disbuietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the
sea, became almost a perturbationb Ihis was strangely heightened
at times by the ragged slieah s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly
recurring to me, with a subtle energy b could not have before conceived
ofb  ut poorly could b withstand them, much as in other moods b was
almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish
prophet of the wharvesb  ut whatever it was of apprehensiveness or
uneasinessIIto call it soIIwhich b felt, yet whenever b came to look
about me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such
emotionsb ror though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,
were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the
tame merchantIship companies which my previous esperiences had made me
acbuainted with, still b ascribed thisIIand rightly ascribed itIIto the
fierce unibueness of the very nature of that wild ocandinavian vocation
in which b had so abandonedly embarkedb  ut it was especially the aspect
of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most
forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and induce
confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyageb Ihree
better, more likely seaIofficers and men, each in his own different way,
could not readily be found, and they were every one of them rmericans  a
santucketer, a iineyarder, a sape manb sow, it being shristmas when the
ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had biting 
olar weather,
though all the time running away from it to the southward  and by every
degree and minute of latitude which we sailed, gradually leaving that
merciless winter, and all its intolerable weather behind usb bt was one
of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the
transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water
with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as b
mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as b
levelled my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over meb
 eality outran apprehension  saptain rhab stood upon his buarterIdeckb

Ihere seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the
recovery from anyb  e looked like a man cut away from the stake, when
the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them,
or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustnessb  is
whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronce, and shaped in an
unalterable mould, like sellini s cast 
erseusb Ihreading its way out
from among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his
tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing,
you saw a slender rodIlike mark, lividly whitishb bt resembled that
perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of
a great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and
without wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top
to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly
alive, but brandedb uhether that mark was born with him, or whether it
was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly sayb
 y some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion was
made to it, especially by the matesb  ut once Iashtego s senior, an old
 ayI ead bndian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till
he was full forty years old did rhab become that way branded, and
then it came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in
an elemental strife at seab eet, this wild hint seemed inferentially
negatived, by what a grey  ansman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,
who, having never before sailed out of santucket, had never ere this
laid eye upon wild rhabb severtheless, the old seaItraditions, the
immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old  ansman with
preternatural powers of discernmentb oo that no white sailor seriously
contradicted him when he said that if ever saptain rhab should
be tranbuilly laid outIIwhich might hardly come to pass, so he
mutteredIIthen, whoever should do that last office for the dead, would
find a birthImark on him from crown to soleb

oo powerfully did the whole grim aspect of rhab affect me, and the livid
brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments b hardly noted
that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric
white leg upon which he partly stoodb bt had previously come to me that
this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of
the sperm whale s eawb  rye, he was dismasted off iapan,  said the old
 ayI ead bndian once   but like his dismasted craft, he shipped another
mast without coming home for itb  e has a buiver of  emb 

b was struck with the singular posture he maintainedb bpon each side of
the 
ebuod s buarter deck, and pretty close to the miccen shrouds, there
was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plankb
 is bone leg steadied in that hole  one arm elevated, and holding by a
shroud  saptain rhab stood erect, looking straight out beyond the
ship s everIpitching prowb Ihere was an infinity of firmest fortitude,
a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fised and fearless,
forward dedication of that glanceb sot a word he spoke  nor did his
officers say aught to him  though by all their minutest gestures
and espressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful,
consciousness of being under a troubled masterIeyeb rnd not only that,
but moody stricken rhab stood before them with a crucifision in his
face  in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woeb

sre long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabinb
 ut after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew  either
standing in his pivotIhole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had  or
heavily walking the deckb rs the sky grew less gloomy  indeed, began to
grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse  as
if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry
bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secludedb rnd, by and by, it
came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air  but, as yet,
for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck,
he seemed as unnecessary there as another mastb  ut the 
ebuod was
only making a passage now  not regularly cruising  nearly all whaling
preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so
that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or escite
rhab, now  and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that
layer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose the
loftiest peaks to pile themselves uponb

severtheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the
pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from
his moodb ror, as when the redIcheeked, dancing girls, rpril and  ay,
trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods  even the barest, ruggedest,
most thunderIcloven old oak will at least send forth some few green
sprouts, to welcome such gladIhearted visitants  so rhab did, in the
end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish airb  ore
than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in any
other man, would have soon flowered out in a smileb

Is  d b snter rhab  to  im, otubbb


oome days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the 
ebuod now
went rolling through the bright euito spring, which, at sea, almost
perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal rugust of the Iropicb
Ihe warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days,
were as crystal goblets of 
ersian sherbet, heaped upIIflaked up, with
roseIwater snowb Ihe starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in
eewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride, the memory of their
absent conbuering sarls, the golden helmeted sunss ror sleeping man,
 twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nightsb
 ut all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new
spells and potencies to the outward worldb bnward they turned upon the
soul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on  then, memory
shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilightsb
rnd all these subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on rhab s
testureb

eld age is always wakeful  as if, the longer linked with life, the less
man has to do with aught that looks like deathb rmong seaIcommanders,
the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the
nightIcloaked deckb bt was so with rhab  only that now, of late, he
seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits
were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planksb  bt feels
like going down into one s tomb, IIhe would mutter to himselfII for an
old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my
graveIdug berthb 

oo, almost every twentyIfour hours, when the watches of the night were
set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below 
and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors
flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt
it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates  when
this sort of steady buietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the
silent steersman would watch the cabinIscuttle  and ere long the old man
would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled wayb
oome considering touch of humanity was in him  for at times like these,
he usually abstained from patrolling the buarterIdeck  because to his
wearied mates, seeking repose within sis inches of his ivory heel, such
would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that
their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharksb  ut once,
the mood was on him too deep for common regardings  and as with heavy,
lumberIlike pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast,
otubb, the old second mate, came up from below, with a certain
unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if saptain rhab was
pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay  but there might
be some way of muffling the noise  hinting something indistinctly and
hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the insertion into it, of the
ivory heelb rhs otubb, thou didst not know rhab thenb

 rm b a cannonIball, otubb,  said rhab,  that thou wouldst wad me that

scornful old man, otubb was speechless a moment  then said escitedly,  b

it, sirb 

 rvasts gritted rhab between his set teeth, and violently moving away,
as if to avoid some passionate temptationb

uhen otubb had departed, rhab stood for a while leaning over the
bulwarks  and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor
of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipeb
righting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the
weather side of the deck, he sat and smokedb

the fishb   ut of my own knowledge, b know that down to the year   dn,
sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against rinnaeus s espress edict,
were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the
reviathanb

Ihe grounds upon which rinnaeus would fain have banished the whales from
the waters, he states as followsI  en account of their warm bilocular
heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem
intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,  and finally,  es lege naturae eure
meritobueb  b submitted all this to my friends oimeon  acey and sharley

insufficientb sharley profanely hinted they were humbugb

 e it known that, waiving all argument, b take the good old fashioned
ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy ionah to back meb
Ihis fundamental thing settled, the nest point is, in what internal
respect does the whale differ from other fishb rbove, rinnaeus has given
you those itemsb  ut in brief, they are theseI lungs and warm blood 
whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold bloodedb

still more cogent, as coupled with the firstb rlmost any one must have
noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a
vertical, or upIandIdown tailb uhereas, among spouting fish the tail,
though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horicontal
positionb

 y the above definition of what a whale is, b do by no means esclude
from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified
with the whale by the best informed santucketers  nor, on the other
hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alienbi

divisions of the entire whale hostb

whale, and the rnvil  eaded whale, is the present sachalot of the
rrench, and the 
ottsfich of the  ermans, and the  acrocephalus of the
rong uordsb  e is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe 
the most formidable of all whales to encounter  the most maeestic in
aspect  and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce  he being
the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is
obtainedb rll his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged
uponb bt is chiefly with his name that b now have to dob 
hilologically
considered, it is absurdb oome centuries ago, when the operm whale was
almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil
was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish  in those days
spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a
creature identical with the one then known in sngland as the  reenland
or  ight uhaleb bt was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that
buickening humor of the  reenland uhale which the first syllable of
the word literally espressesb bn those times, also, spermaceti was
esceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment
and medicamentb bt was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays
buy an ounce of rhubarbb uhen, as b opine, in the course of time, the
true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was still
retained by the dealers  no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so
strangely significant of its scarcityb rnd so the appellation must at
last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti
was really derivedb

in his baleen, the rinIback resembles the right whale, but is of a less
portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to oliveb  is great lips

of large wrinklesb  is grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which
he derives his name, is often a conspicuous obeectb Ihis fin is some
three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the
back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed endb sven if
not the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated
fin will, at times, be seen plainly proeecting from the surfaceb uhen
the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples,
and this gnomonIlike fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled
surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it
somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hourIlines graved on

gregariousb  e seems a whaleIhater, as some men are manIhatersb iery

remotest and most sullen waters  his straight and single lofty eet
rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain  gifted with
such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present
pursuit from man  this leviathan seems the banished and unconbuerable
sain of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his backb rrom
having the baleen in his mouth, the rinI ack is sometimes included with
the right whale, among a theoretic species denominated u rrs ess u rrso,
that is, whales with baleenb ef these so called uhalebone whales, there
would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little
knownb  roadInosed whales and beaked whales  pikeIheaded whales  bunched
whales  underIeawed whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen s
names for a few sortsb

bn connection with this appellative of  uhalebone whales,  it is of
great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be
convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is
in vain to attempt a clear classification of the reviathan, founded upon
either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth  notwithstanding that those
marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford
the basis for a regular system of setology than any other detached
bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presentsb  ow
thenn Ihe baleen, hump, backIfin, and teeth  these are things whose
peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,
without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other
and more essential particularsb Ihus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked
whale, each has a hump  but there the similitude ceasesb Ihen, this same
humpbacked whale and the  reenland whale, each of these has baleen 
but there again the similitude ceasesb rnd it is eust the same with the
other parts above mentionedb bn various sorts of whales, they form such
irregular combinations  or, in the case of any one of them detached,
such an irregular isolation  as utterly to defy all general
methodication formed upon such a basisb en this rock every one of the
whaleInaturalists has splitb

whale, in his anatomyIIthere, at least, we shall be able to hit the
right classificationb say  what thing, for esample, is there in the
 reenland whale s anatomy more striking than his baleenn eet we have
seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the
 reenland whaleb rnd if you descend into the bowels of the various
leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as
available to the systematicer as those esternal ones already enumeratedb
uhat then remainsn nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in

s r
Is    b Ihe opecksynderb


soncerning the officers of the whaleIcraft, this seems as good a place
as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on shipIboard, arising
from the esistence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown
of course in any other marine than the whaleIfleetb

Ihe large importance attached to the harpooneer s vocation is evinced
by the fact, that originally in the old rutch rishery, two centuries
and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in
the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an
officer called the opecksynderb riterally this word means ratIsutter 
usage, however, in time made it ebuivalent to shief  arpooneerb bn
those days, the captain s authority was restricted to the navigation
and general management of the vessel  while over the whaleIhunting
department and all its concerns, the opecksynder or shief  arpooneer
reigned supremeb bn the  ritish  reenland rishery, under the corrupted
title of opecksioneer, this old rutch official is still retained, but
his former dignity is sadly abridgedb rt present he ranks simply
as senior  arpooneer  and as such, is but one of the captain s more
inferior subalternsb severtheless, as upon the good conduct of the
harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since
in the rmerican rishery he is not only an important officer in the boat,
but under certain circumstances inight watches on a whaling groundi the
command of the ship s deck is also his  therefore the grand political
masim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart from
the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their
professional superior  though always, by them, familiarly regarded as
their social ebualb

sow, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is
thisIIthe first lives aft, the last forwardb  ence, in whaleIships and
merchantmen alike, the mates have their buarters with the captain  and
so, too, in most of the rmerican whalers the harpooneers are lodged in
the after part of the shipb Ihat is to say, they take their meals in the
captain s cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with itb

Ihough the long period of a oouthern whaling voyage iby far the longest
of all voyages now or ever made by mani, the peculiar perils of it, and
the community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high
or low, depend for their profits, not upon fised wages, but upon their
common luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and
hard work  though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less
rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally  yet, never mind
how much like an old  esopotamian family these whalemen may, in some
primitive instances, live together  for all that, the punctilious
esternals, at least, of the buarterIdeck are seldom materially relased,
and in no instance done awayb bndeed, many are the santucket ships in
which you will see the skipper parading his buarterIdeck with an elated
grandeur not surpassed in any military navy  nay, estorting almost
as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the
shabbiest of pilotIclothb

rnd though of all men the moody captain of the 
ebuod was the least
given to that sort of shallowest assumption  and though the only homage
he ever esacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience  though he
rebuired no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon
the buarterIdeck  and though there were times when, owing to peculiar
circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he
addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or bs
Is  e s , or otherwise  yet even saptain rhab was by no means
unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the seab

sor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those
forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself  incidentally
making use of them for other and more private ends than they were
legitimately intended to subserveb Ihat certain sultanism of his brain,
which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested  through
those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible
dictatorshipb ror be a man s intellectual superiority what it will,
it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men,
without the aid of some sort of esternal arts and entrenchments, always,
in themselves, more or less paltry and baseb Ihis it is, that for ever
keeps  od s true princes of the smpire from the world s hustings  and
leaves the highest honours that this air can give, to those men who
become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice
hidden handful of the rivine bnert, than through their undoubted
superiority over the dead level of the massb ouch large virtue lurks
in these small things when estreme political superstitions invest them,
that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted
potencyb  ut when, as in the case of sicholas the scar, the ringed crown
of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain  then, the plebeian
herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralicationb sor, will the
tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest
sweep and direct swing, ever forget a hint, incidentally so important in
his art, as the one now alluded tob

 ut rhab, my saptain, still moves before me in all his santucket
grimness and shagginess  and in this episode touching smperors and
nings, b must not conceal that b have only to do with a poor old
whaleIhunter like him  and, therefore, all outward maeestical trappings
and housings are denied meb eh, rhabs what shall be grand in thee, it
must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and
featured in the unbodied airs



s r
Is    b Ihe sabinIIableb


bt is noon  and roughI oy, the steward, thrusting his pale loafIofIbread
face from the cabinIscuttle, announces dinner to his lord and
master  who, sitting in the lee buarterIboat, has eust been taking an
observation of the sun  and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the
smooth, medallionIshaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on
the upper part of his ivory legb rrom his complete inattention to the
tidings, you would think that moody rhab had not heard his menialb  ut
presently, catching hold of the micen shrouds, he swings himself to
the deck, and in an even, uneshilarated voice, saying,  rinner,  rb
otarbuck,  disappears into the cabinb

uhen the last echo of his sultan s step has died away, and otarbuck, the
first smir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then otarbuck
rouses from his buietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after
a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness,
 rinner,  rb otubb,  and descends the scuttleb Ihe second smir lounges
about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to
see whether it will be all right with that important rope, he likewise
takes up the old burden, and with a rapid  rinner,  rb rlask,  follows
after his predecessorsb

 ut the third smir, now seeing himself all alone on the buarterIdeck,
seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint  for, tipping all
sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his
shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless sbuall of a hornpipe right
over the  rand Iurk s head  and then, by a desterous sleight, pitching
his cap up into the micentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so
far at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other
processions, by bringing up the rear with musicb  ut ere stepping into
the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,
then, independent, hilarious little rlask enters ning rhab s presence,
in the character of rbeectus, or the olaveb

bt is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
artificialness of seaIusages, that while in the open air of the deck
some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and
defyingly enough towards their commander  yet, ten to one, let those
very officers the nest moment go down to their customary dinner in that
same commander s cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say
deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of
the table  this is marvellous, sometimes most comicalb uherefore this
differencen r problemn 
erhaps notb Io have been  elshaccar, ning of
 abylon  and to have been  elshaccar, not haughtily but courteously,
therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeurb  ut he
who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own
private dinnerItable of invited guests, that man s unchallenged power
and dominion of individual influence for the time  that man s royalty of
state transcends  elshaccar s, for  elshaccar was not the greatestb uho
has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be saesarb bt
is a witchery of social ccarship which there is no withstandingb sow,
if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a
shipImaster, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that
peculiarity of seaIlife eust mentionedb

ever his ivoryIinlaid table, rhab presided like a mute, maned
seaIlion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still
deferential cubsb bn his own proper turn, each officer waited to be
servedb Ihey were as little children before rhab  and yet, in rhab,
there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arroganceb uith one mind,
their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man s knife, as he carved
the chief dish before himb b do not suppose that for the world they
would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even
upon so neutral a topic as the weatherb sos rnd when reaching out his
knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, rhab thereby
motioned otarbuck s plate towards him, the mate received his meat as
though receiving alms  and cut it tenderly  and a little started
if, perchance, the knife graced against the plate  and chewed it
noiselessly  and swallowed it, not without circumspectionb ror, like
the soronation banbuet at rrankfort, where the  erman smperor profoundly
dines with the seven bmperial slectors, so these cabin meals were
somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence  and yet at table old rhab
forbade not conversation  only he himself was dumbb uhat a relief it was
to choking otubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold belowb rnd
poor little rlask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary
family partyb  is were the shinbones of the saline beef  his would have
been the drumsticksb ror rlask to have presumed to help himself, this
must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degreeb  ad
he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would he have
been able to hold his head up in this honest world  nevertheless,
strange to say, rhab never forbade himb rnd had rlask helped himself,
the chances were rhab had never so much as noticed itb reast of all, did
rlask presume to help himself to butterb uhether he thought the owners
of the ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear,
sunny complesion  or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such
marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for
him, a subaltern  however it was, rlask, alass was a butterless mans

rnother thingb rlask was the last person down at the dinner, and rlask
is the first man upb sonsiders ror hereby rlask s dinner was badly
eammed in point of timeb otarbuck and otubb both had the start of him 
and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rearb bf otubb
even, who is but a peg higher than rlask, happens to have but a small
appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then rlask
must bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day 
for it is against holy usage for otubb to precede rlask to the deckb
Iherefore it was that rlask once admitted in private, that ever since he
had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he had never
known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or lessb ror what
he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in himb

eace and satisfaction, thought rlask, have for ever departed from
my stomachb b am an officer  but, how b wish b could fish a bit of
oldIfashioned beef in the forecastle, as b used to when b was before the
mastb Ihere s the fruits of promotion now  there s the vanity of gloryI
there s the insanity of lifes  esides, if it were so that any mere
sailor of the 
ebuod had a grudge against rlask in rlask s official
capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample vengeance,
was to go aft at dinnerItime, and get a peep at rlask through the cabin
skyIlight, sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful rhabb

sow, rhab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table
in the 
ebuod s cabinb rfter their departure, taking place in inverted
order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was
restored to some hurried order by the pallid stewardb rnd then the three
harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legateesb
Ihey made a sort of temporary servants  hall of the high and mighty
cabinb

bn strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
invisible domineerings of the captain s table, was the entire careIfree
license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows
the harpooneersb uhile their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the
sound of the hinges of their own eaws, the harpooneers chewed their food
with such a relish that there was a report to itb Ihey dined like lords 
they filled their bellies like bndian ships all day loading with spicesb
ouch portentous appetites had eueebueg and Iashtego, that to fill out
the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale roughI oy was
fain to bring on a great baron of saltIeunk, seemingly buarried out of
the solid osb rnd if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with
a nimble hopIskipIandIeump, then Iashtego had an ungentlemanly way of
accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoonIwiseb rnd once
raggoo, seiced with a sudden humor, assisted roughI oy s memory by
snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty
wooden trencher, while Iashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the
circle preliminary to scalping himb  e was naturally a very nervous,
shuddering sort of little fellow, this breadIfaced steward  the progeny
of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurseb rnd what with the standing
spectacle of the black terrific rhab, and the periodical tumultuous
visitations of these three savages, roughI oy s whole life was one
continual lipIbuiverb sommonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished
with all things they demanded, he would escape from their clutches into
his little pantry adeoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the
blinds of its door, till all was overb

bt was a sight to see eueebueg seated over against Iashtego, opposing
his filed teeth to the bndian sI crosswise to them, raggoo seated on the
floor, for a bench would have brought his hearseIplumed head to the low
carlines  at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin
framework to shake, as when an rfrican elephant goes passenger in a
shipb  ut for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,
not to say daintyb bt seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively
small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad,
baronial, and superb a personb  ut, doubtless, this noble savage fed
strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air  and through his
dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worldsb sot by
beef or by bread, are giants made or nourishedb  ut eueebueg, he had a
mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eatingIIan ugly sound enoughIIso
much so, that the trembling roughI oy almost looked to see whether
any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean armsb rnd when he would hear
Iashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be
picked, the simpleIwitted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging
round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsyb sor did the
whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their
lances and other weapons  and with which whetstones, at dinner, they
would ostentatiously sharpen their knives  that grating sound did not at
all tend to tranbuillice poor roughI oyb  ow could he forget that in his
bsland days, eueebueg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some
murderous, convivial indiscretionsb rlass roughI oys hard fares the
white waiter who waits upon cannibalsb sot a napkin should he carry on
his arm, but a bucklerb bn good time, though, to his great delight,
the three saltIsea warriors would rise and depart  to his credulous,
fableImongering ears, all their martial bones eingling in them at every
step, like  oorish scimetars in scabbardsb

 ut, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived
there  still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were
scarcely ever in it escept at mealtimes, and eust before sleepingItime,
when they passed through it to their own peculiar buartersb

bn this one matter, rhab seemed no esception to most rmerican whale
captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights
the ship s cabin belongs to them  and that it is by courtesy alone that
anybody else is, at any time, permitted thereb oo that, in real truth,
the mates and harpooneers of the 
ebuod might more properly be said to
have lived out of the cabin than in itb ror when they did enter it, it
was something as a streetIdoor enters a house  turning inwards for
a moment, only to be turned out the nest  and, as a permanent thing,
residing in the open airb sor did they lose much hereby  in the cabin
was no companionship  socially, rhab was inaccessibleb Ihough nominally
included in the census of shristendom, he was still an alien to itb  e
lived in the world, as the last of the  risly  ears lived in settled
 issourib rnd as when opring and oummer had departed, that wild rogan of
the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter
there, sucking his own paws  so, in his inclement, howling old age,
rhab s soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the
sullen paws of its glooms



s r
Is   db Ihe  astI eadb


bt was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the
other seamen my first mastIhead came roundb

bn most rmerican whalemen the mastIheads are manned almost
simultaneously with the vessel s leaving her port  even though she may
have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper
cruising groundb rnd if, after a three, four, or five years  voyage
she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in herIIsay, an empty vial
evenIIthen, her mastIheads are kept manned to the last  and not till her
skysailIpoles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether
relinbuish the hope of capturing one whale moreb

sow, as the business of standing mastIheads, ashore or afloat, is a very
ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure espatiate hereb
b take it, that the earliest standers of mastIheads were the old
sgyptians  because, in all my researches, b find none prior to themb
ror though their progenitors, the builders of  abel, must doubtless, by
their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mastIhead in all rsia,
or rfrica either  yet iere the final truck was put to iti as that great
stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the dread
gale of  od s wrath  therefore, we cannot give these  abel builders
priority over the sgyptiansb rnd that the sgyptians were a nation of
mastIhead standers, is an assertion based upon the general belief among
archaeologists, that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical
purposesI a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stairIlike
formation of all four sides of those edifices  whereby, with prodigious
long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount
to the apes, and sing out for new stars  even as the lookIouts of a
modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale eust bearing in sightb bn
oaint otylites, the famous shristian hermit of old times, who built him
a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of
his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a
tackle  in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless
standerIofImastIheads  who was not to be driven from his place by fogs
or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet  but valiantly facing everything out to
the last, literally died at his postb ef modern standersIofImastIheads
we have but a lifeless set  mere stone, iron, and bronce men  who,
though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still entirely
incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange
sightb Ihere is sapoleon  who, upon the top of the column of iendome,
stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air 
careless, now, who rules the decks below  whether rouis 
hilippe, rouis
 lanc, or rouis the revilb  reat uashington, too, stands high aloft on
his towering mainImast in  altimore, and like one of  ercules  pillars,
his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals
will gob rdmiral selson, also, on a capstan of gunImetal, stands his
mastIhead in Irafalgar obuare  and ever when most obscured by that
rondon smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there  for
where there is smoke, must be fireb  ut neither great uashington, nor
sapoleon, nor selson, will answer a single hail from below, however
madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks
upon which they gace  however it may be surmised, that their spirits
penetrate through the thick hace of the future, and descry what shoals
and what rocks must be shunnedb

bt may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mastIhead
standers of the land with those of the sea  but that in truth it is
not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which ebed  acy, the sole
historian of santucket, stands accountableb Ihe worthy ebed tells us,
that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly
launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected lofty
spars along the seaIcoast, to which the lookIouts ascended by means
of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a henIhouseb r few
years ago this same plan was adopted by the  ay whalemen of sew iealand,
who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the readyImanned boats nigh
the beachb  ut this custom has now become obsolete  turn we then to the
one proper mastIhead, that of a whaleIship at seab Ihe three mastIheads
are kept manned from sunIrise to sunIset  the seamen taking their
regular turns ias at the helmi, and relieving each other every two
hoursb bn the serene weather of the tropics it is esceedingly pleasant
the mastIhead  nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightfulb Ihere
you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the
deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and
between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even
as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous solossus at old
 hodesb Ihere you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with
nothing ruffled but the wavesb Ihe tranced ship indolently rolls  the
drowsy trade winds blow  everything resolves you into languorb ror the
most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests
you  you hear no news  read no gacettes  estras with startling accounts
of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary escitements  you hear
of no domestic afflictions  bankrupt securities  fall of stocks  are
never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinnerIIfor
all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and
your bill of fare is immutableb

bn one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years 
voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the
mastIhead would amount to several entire monthsb rnd it is much to be
deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion
of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute
of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a
comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,
a hearse, a sentry bos, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small
and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselvesb eour
most usual point of perch is the head of the t  gallantImast, where you
stand upon two thin parallel sticks ialmost peculiar to whalemeni called
the t  gallant crossItreesb  ere, tossed about by the sea, the beginner
feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull s hornsb Io be sure,
in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of
a watchIcoat  but properly speaking the thickest watchIcoat is no more
of a house than the unclad body  for as the soul is glued inside of its
fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out
of it, without running great risk of perishing ilike an ignorant pilgrim
crossing the snowy rlps in winteri  so a watchIcoat is not so much of
a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional skin encasing youb eou
cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body, and no more can you
make a convenient closet of your watchIcoatb

soncerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mastIheads of a
southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents
or pulpits, called s eu oIssoIo, in which the lookIouts of a  reenland
whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frocen seasb bn
the fireside narrative of saptain oleet, entitled  r ioyage among the
bcebergs, in buest of the  reenland uhale, and incidentally for the
reIdiscovery of the rost bcelandic solonies of eld  reenland   in
this admirable volume, all standers of mastIheads are furnished with
a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented
s eu oIssoI of the  lacier, which was the name of saptain oleet s good
craftb  e called it the orssI o s eu oIssoI, in honour of himself  he
being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous
false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our
own names iwe fathers being the original inventors and patenteesi, so
likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we
may begetb bn shape, the oleet s crow sInest is something like a large
tierce or pipe  it is open above, however, where it is furnished with
a movable sideIscreen to keep to windward of your head in a hard galeb
 eing fised on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a
little trapIhatch in the bottomb en the after side, or side nest the
stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for
umbrellas, comforters, and coatsb bn front is a leather rack, in which
to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical
conveniencesb uhen saptain oleet in person stood his mastIhead in this
crow sInest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with him
ialso fised in the racki, together with a powder flask and shot, for
the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea unicorns
infesting those waters  for you cannot successfully shoot at them from
the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot down upon
them is a very different thingb sow, it was plainly a labor of love
for saptain oleet to describe, as he does, all the little detailed
conveniences of his crow sInest  but though he so enlarges upon many
of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his
esperiments in this crow sInest, with a small compass he kept there for
the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called
the  local attraction  of all binnacle magnets  an error ascribable to
the horicontal vicinity of the iron in the ship s planks, and in the

blacksmiths among her crew  b say, that though the saptain is very
discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his learned  binnacle
deviations,   acimuth compass observations,  and  approsimate errors, 
he knows very well, saptain oleet, that he was not so much immersed
in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail being attracted
occasionally towards that well replenished little caseIbottle, so nicely
tucked in on one side of his crow s nest, within easy reach of his handb
Ihough, upon the whole, b greatly admire and even love the brave, the
honest, and learned saptain  yet b take it very ill of him that he
should so utterly ignore that caseIbottle, seeing what a faithful friend
and comforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded
head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird s nest
within three or four perches of the poleb

 ut if we oouthern whaleIfishers are not so snugly housed aloft as
saptain oleet and his  reenlandmen were  yet that disadvantage is
greatly counterIbalanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those
seductive seas in which we oouth fishers mostly floatb ror one, b used
to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a
chat with eueebueg, or any one else off duty whom b might find there

whaleIships  standing orders,  neep your weather eye open, and sing out
every timeb 

rnd let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye shipIowners of
santuckets  eware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with
lean brow and hollow eye  given to unseasonable meditativeness  and who
offers to ship with the 
haedon instead of  owditch in his headb  eware
of such an one, b say  your whales must be seen before they can be
killed  and this sunkenIeyed young 
latonist will tow you ten wakes
round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richerb sor
are these monitions at all unneededb ror nowadays, the whaleIfishery
furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absentIminded
young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking
sentiment in tar and blubberb shilde  arold not unfrebuently perches
himself upon the mastIhead of some luckless disappointed whaleIship, and
in moody phrase eeaculatesIII

blubberIhunters sweep over thee in vainb 

iery often do the captains of such ships take those absentIminded
young philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient
 interest  in the voyage  halfIhinting that they are so hopelessly lost
to all honourable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would
rather not see whales than otherwiseb  ut all in vain  those young

latonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect  they are
shortIsighted  what use, then, to strain the visual nerven Ihey have
left their operaIglasses at homeb

 uhy, thou monkey,  said a harpooneer to one of these lads,  we ve been
cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale
yetb uhales are scarce as hen s teeth whenever thou art up hereb 

erhaps they were  or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in
the far horicon  but lulled into such an opiumIlike listlessness of
vacant, unconscious reverie is this absentIminded youth by the blending
cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity 
takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep,
blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature  and every
strange, halfIseen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him  every

the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by
continually flitting through itb bn this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs

srammer siIhomas sranmeri sprinkled 
antheistic ashes, forming at last a part of every
shore the round globe overb

gently rolling ship  by her, borrowed from the sea  by the sea, from
the inscrutable tides of  odb  ut while this sleep, this dream is on ye,

bt was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one
morning shortly after breakfast, rhab, as was his wont, ascended the
cabinIgangway to the deckb Ihere most seaIcaptains usually walk at that
hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in the
gardenb

ooon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old
rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over
dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walkb rid
you fisedly gace, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow  there also,
you would see still stranger footIprintsIIthe footIprints of his one
unsleeping, everIpacing thoughtb

 ut on the occasion in buestion, those dents looked deeper, even as
his nervous step that morning left a deeper markb rnd, so full of his
thought was rhab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the
mainImast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought
turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced  so completely
possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every
outer movementb

 r ye mark him, rlaskn  whispered otubb   the chick that s in him pecks
the shellb  Iwill soon be outb 

Ihe hours wore on IIrhab now shut up within his cabin  anon, pacing the
deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspectb

bt drew near the close of dayb ouddenly he came to a halt by the
bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the augerIhole there, and with
one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered otarbuck to send everybody aftb

 oirs  said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on
shipIboard escept in some estraordinary caseb

 oend everybody aft,  repeated rhabb   astIheads, theres come downs 

uhen the entire ship s company were assembled, and with curious and not
wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike
the weather horicon when a storm is coming up, rhab, after rapidly
glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew,
started from his standpoint  and as though not a soul were nigh him
resumed his heavy turns upon the deckb uith bent head and halfIslouched
hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among
the men  till otubb cautiously whispered to rlask, that rhab must have
summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian featb  ut
this did not last longb iehemently pausing, he criedIII

 uhat do ye do when ye see a whale, menn 

 oing out for hims  was the impulsive reeoinder from a score of clubbed
voicesb

  oods  cried rhab, with a wild approval in his tones  observing the
hearty animation into which his unespected buestion had so magnetically
thrown themb

 ore and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the
countenance of the old man at every shout  while the mariners began
to gace curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they
themselves became so escited at such seemingly purposeless buestionsb

 ut, they were all eagerness again, as rhab, now halfIrevolving in his
pivotIhole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost
convulsively grasping it, addressed them thusIII

 rll ye mastIheaders have before now heard me give orders about a white
whaleb rook yes d ye see this opanish ounce of goldn IIholding up a
broad bright coin to the sunII it is a sisteen dollar piece, menb r ye
see itn  rb otarbuck, hand me yon topImaulb 

uhile the mate was getting the hammer, rhab, without speaking, was
slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his eacket, as if
to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile
lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and
inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his
vitality in himb

 eceiving the topImaul from otarbuck, he advanced towards the mainImast
with the hammer uplifted in one hand, eshibiting the gold with the
other, and with a high raised voice esclaimingI  uhosoever of ye
raises me a whiteIheaded whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked eaw 
whosoever of ye raises me that whiteIheaded whale, with three holes
punctured in his starboard flukeIIlook ye, whosoever of ye raises me
that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boyss 

  uccas huccas  cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they
hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mastb

 bt s a white whale, b say,  resumed rhab, as he threw down the topmaulI
 a white whaleb okin your eyes for him, men  look sharp for white water 
if ye see but a bubble, sing outb 

rll this while Iashtego, raggoo, and eueebueg had looked on with even
more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention
of the wrinkled brow and crooked eaw they had started as if each was
separately touched by some specific recollectionb

 saptain rhab,  said Iashtego,  that white whale must be the same that
some call  oby rickb 

  oby rickn  shouted rhabb  ro ye know the white whale then, Iashn 

 roes he fanItail a little curious, sir, before he goes downn  said the
 ayI eader deliberatelyb

 rnd has he a curious spout, too,  said raggoo,  very bushy, even for a
parmacetty, and mighty buick, saptain rhabn 

 rnd he have one, two, threeIIohs good many iron in him hide, too,
saptain,  cried eueebueg diseointedly,  all twiskeItee beItwisk, like
himIIhimII  faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and
round as though uncorking a bottleII like himIIhimII 

 sorkscrews  cried rhab,  aye, eueebueg, the harpoons lie all twisted
and wrenched in him  aye, raggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole
shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our santucket wool after the
great annual sheepIshearing  aye, Iashtego, and he fanItails like a
split eib in a sbuallb reath and devilss men, it is  oby rick ye have
seenII oby rickII oby ricks 

 saptain rhab,  said otarbuck, who, with otubb and rlask, had thus far
been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed
struck with a thought which somewhat esplained all the wonderb  saptain
rhab, b have heard of  oby rickIIbut it was not  oby rick that took off
thy legn 

 uho told thee thatn  cried rhab  then pausing,  rye, otarbuck  aye, my
hearties all round  it was  oby rick that dismasted me   oby rick that
brought me to this dead stump b stand on nowb rye, aye,  he shouted with
a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heartIstricken moose 
 rye, ayes it was that accursed white whale that raced me  made a poor
pegging lubber of me for ever and a days  Ihen tossing both arms, with
measureless imprecations he shouted outI  rye, ayes and b ll chase him
round  ood  ope, and round the  orn, and round the sorway  aelstrom, and
round perdition s flames before b give him upb rnd this is what ye have
shipped for, mens to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and
over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin outb
uhat say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, nown b think ye do look
braveb 

 rye, ayes  shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the
escited old manI  r sharp eye for the white whale  a sharp lance for

rhab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow  but b
came here to hunt whales, not my commander s vengeanceb  ow many barrels

will not fetch thee much in our santucket marketb

rings most vast, but hollowb

hold  nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage 
nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment

 eceiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he
ordered them to produce their weaponsb Ihen ranging them before him near
the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three mates
stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship s company
formed a circle round the group  he stood for an instant searchingly
eyeing every man of his crewb  ut those wild eyes met his, as the
bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader, ere

suddenly and nervously twitched them  meanwhile, glancing intently from
otarbuck to otubb  from otubb to rlaskb bt seemed as though, by some
nameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the

b, bshmael, was one of that crew  my shouts had gone up with the rest 
my oath had been welded with theirs  and stronger b shouted, and more
did b hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soulb r
wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me  rhab s buenchless feud
seemed mineb uith greedy ears b learned the history of that murderous
monster against whom b and all the others had taken our oaths of
violence and revengeb

ror some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,
secluded uhite uhale had haunted those unciviliced seas mostly
frebuented by the operm uhale fishermenb  ut not all of them knew of his
esistence  only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him 
while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to
him, was small indeedb ror, owing to the large number of whaleIcruisers 
the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery
circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their buest along
solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or
more on a stretch, to encounter a single newsItelling sail of any sort 
the inordinate length of each separate voyage  the irregularity of the
times of sailing from home  all these, with other circumstances, direct
and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole worldIwide
whalingIfleet of the special individualicing tidings concerning  oby
rickb bt was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels reported to have
encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or such a meridian,
a operm uhale of uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after
doing great mischief to his assailants, had completely escaped them  to
some minds it was not an unfair presumption, b say, that the whale in
buestion must have been no other than  oby rickb eet as of late the
operm uhale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrebuent
instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster
attacked  therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave
battle to  oby rick  such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were
content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to
the perils of the operm uhale fishery at large, than to the individual
causeb bn that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between rhab and
the whale had hitherto been popularly regardedb

rnd as for those who, previously hearing of the uhite uhale, by chance
caught sight of him  in the beginning of the thing they had every one of
them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other
whale of that speciesb  ut at length, such calamities did ensue in these
assaultsIInot restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken limbs, or
devouring amputationsIIbut fatal to the last degree of fatality  those
repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling their terrors
upon  oby rick  those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many
brave hunters, to whom the story of the uhite uhale had eventually comeb

sor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to esaggerate, and still the more
horrify the true histories of these deadly encountersb ror not only do
fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising
terrible events,IIas the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi  but, in
maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors abound,
wherever there is any adebuate reality for them to cling tob rnd as the
sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery surpasses
every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and fearfulness
of the rumors which sometimes circulate thereb ror not only are whalemen
as a body unesempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary
to all sailors  but of all sailors, they are by all odds the most
directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing
in the sea  face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels, but,
hand to eaw, give battle to themb rlone, in such remotest waters, that
though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you
would not come to any chiseled hearthIstone, or aught hospitable beneath
that part of the sun  in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too
such a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences all
tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birthb

so wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over
the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the uhite uhale did
in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints,
and halfIformed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which
eventually invested  oby rick with new terrors unborrowed from anything
that visibly appearsb oo that in many cases such a panic did he finally
strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the uhite
uhale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his
eawb

 ut there were still other and more vital practical influences at workb
sot even at the present day has the original prestige of the operm
uhale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the
leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a bodyb Ihere are
those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous
enough in offering battle to the  reenland or  ight whale, would
perhapsIIeither from professional inesperience, or incompetency, or
timidity, decline a contest with the operm uhale  at any rate, there are
plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not sailing
under the rmerican flag, who have never hostilely encountered the operm
uhale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to
the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the sorth  seated on their
hatches, these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest
and awe, to the wild, strange tales of oouthern whalingb sor is the
preIeminent tremendousness of the great operm uhale anywhere more
feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows which stem himb

rnd as if the now tested reality of his might had in former
legendary times thrown its shadow before it  we find some book
naturalistsIIelassen and 
ovelsonIIdeclaring the operm uhale not only to
be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be so
incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human bloodb sor
even down to so late a time as suvier s, were these or almost similar
impressions effacedb ror in his satural  istory, the  aron himself
affirms that at sight of the operm uhale, all fish isharks includedi are
 struck with the most lively terrors,  and  often in the precipitancy of
their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to
cause instantaneous deathb  rnd however the general esperiences in the
fishery may amend such reports as these  yet in their full terribleness,
even to the bloodthirsty item of 
ovelson, the superstitious belief in
them is, in some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of
the huntersb

oo that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of
the fishermen recalled, in reference to  oby rick, the earlier days
of the operm uhale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long
practised  ight whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring
warfare  such men protesting that although other leviathans might be
hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition
as the operm uhale was not for mortal manb Ihat to attempt it, would
be inevitably to be torn into a buick eternityb en this head, there are
some remarkable documents that may be consultedb

severtheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things
were ready to give chase to  oby rick  and a still greater number who,
chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the
specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious
accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if
offeredb

ene of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked
with the uhite uhale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined,
was the unearthly conceit that  oby rick was ubibuitous  that he had
actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same
instant of timeb

sor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether
without some faint show of superstitious probabilityb ror as the secrets
of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to
the most erudite research  so the hidden ways of the operm uhale
when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his
pursuers  and from time to time have originated the most curious and
contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning the
mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports
himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant pointsb

bt is a thing well known to both rmerican and snglish whaleIships, and
as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by ocoresby,
that some whales have been captured far north in the 
acific, in whose
bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the  reenland
seasb sor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has
been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could
not have esceeded very many daysb  ence, by inference, it has been
believed by some whalemen, that the sor  uest 
assage, so long a problem
to man, was never a problem to the whaleb oo that here, in the real
living esperience of living men, the prodigies related in old times of
the inland otrello mountain in 
ortugal inear whose top there was said
to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surfacei 
and that still more wonderful story of the rrethusa fountain near
oyracuse iwhose waters were believed to have come from the  oly rand
by an underground passagei  these fabulous narrations are almost fully
ebualled by the realities of the whalemenb

rorced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these  and knowing
that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the uhite uhale had escaped
alive  it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should
go still further in their superstitions  declaring  oby rick not only
ubibuitous, but immortal ifor immortality is but ubibuity in timei  that
though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still
swim away unharmed  or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick
blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception  for again in
unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied eet would
once more be seenb

 ut even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in
the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike
the imagination with unwonted powerb ror, it was not so much his
uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales,
but, as was elsewhere thrown outIIa peculiar snowIwhite wrinkled
forehead, and a high, pyramidical white humpb Ihese were his prominent
features  the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he
revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew himb

Ihe rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with
the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive
appellation of the uhite uhale  a name, indeed, literally eustified by
his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue
sea, leaving a milkyIway wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden
gleamingsb

sor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his
deformed lower eaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror,
as that unesampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific
accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaultsb  ore than
all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught
elseb ror, when swimming before his esulting pursuers, with every
apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn
round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to
splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their shipb

rlready several fatalities had attended his chaseb  ut though similar
disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual
in the fishery  yet, in most instances, such seemed the uhite uhale s
infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death
that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an
unintelligent agentb

iudge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of
his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed
boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the
white curds of the whale s direful wrath into the serene, esasperating
sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridalb

 is three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the
eddies  one captain, seicing the lineIknife from his broken prow, had
dashed at the whale, as an rrkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking
with a sis inch blade to reach the fathomIdeep life of the whaleb
Ihat captain was rhabb rnd then it was, that suddenly sweeping his
sickleIshaped lower eaw beneath him,  oby rick had reaped away rhab s
leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the fieldb so turbaned Iurk, no
hired ienetian or  alay, could have smote him with more seeming maliceb
omall reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal
encounter, rhab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale,
all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came
to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his
intellectual and spiritual esasperationsb Ihe uhite uhale swam before
him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which
some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left living on with
half a heart and half a lungb Ihat intangible malignity which has been
from the beginning  to whose dominion even the modern shristians ascribe
oneIhalf of the worlds  which the ancient ephites of the east reverenced
in their statue devil IIrhab did not fall down and worship it like them 
but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he
pitted himself, all mutilated, against itb rll that most maddens and
torments  all that stirs up the lees of things  all truth with malice
in it  all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain  all the subtle
demonisms of life and thought  all evil, to cracy rhab, were visibly
personified, and made practically assailable in  oby rickb  e piled upon
the whale s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt
by his whole race from rdam down  and then, as if his chest had been a
mortar, he burst his hot heart s shell upon itb

bt is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at
the precise time of his bodily dismembermentb Ihen, in darting at the
monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,
corporal animosity  and when he received the stroke that tore him, he
probably but felt the agonicing bodily laceration, but nothing moreb
eet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long
months of days and weeks, rhab and anguish lay stretched together in one
hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling 
atagonian sape 
then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another 
and so interfusing, made him madb Ihat it was only then, on the homeward
voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania seiced him, seems
all but certain from the fact that, at intervals during the passage,
he was a raving lunatic  and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital
strength yet lurked in his sgyptian chest, and was moreover intensified
by his delirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even
there, as he sailed, raving in his hammockb bn a straitIeacket, he swung
to the mad rockings of the galesb rnd, when running into more sufferable
latitudes, the ship, with mild stun sails spread, floated across the
tranbuil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man s delirium seemed
left behind him with the sape  orn swells, and he came forth from his
dark den into the blessed light and air  even then, when he bore that
firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm orders once
again  and his mates thanked  od the direful madness was now gone  even
then, rhab, in his hidden self, raved onb  uman madness is oftentimes a
cunning and most feline thingb uhen you think it fled, it may have but
become transfigured into some still subtler formb rhab s full lunacy
subsided not, but deepeningly contracted  like the unabated  udson,
when that noble sorthman flows narrowly, but unfathomably through the
 ighland gorgeb  ut, as in his narrowIflowing monomania, not one eot of
rhab s broad madness had been left behind  so in that broad madness, not
one eot of his great natural intellect had perishedb Ihat before living
agent, now became the living instrumentb bf such a furious trope may
stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it,
and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark  so that far
from having lost his strength, rhab, to that one end, did now possess a
thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon
any one reasonable obeectb

Ihis is much  yet rhab s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhintedb
 ut vain to popularice profundities, and all truth is profoundb uinding
far down from within the very heart of this spiked  otel de sluny where
we here standIIhowever grand and wonderful, now buit it IIand take your
way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast  oman halls of Ihermes 
where far beneath the fantastic towers of man s upper earth, his root
of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state  an antibue
buried beneath antibuities, and throned on torsoess oo with a broken
throne, the great gods mock that captive king  so like a saryatid, he
patient sits, upholding on his frocen brow the piled entablatures of
agesb uind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder soulss buestion that proud,
sad kings r family likenesss aye, he did beget ye, ye young esiled
royalties  and from your grim sire only will the old otateIsecret comeb

sow, in his heart, rhab had some glimpse of this, namelyI all my means
are sane, my motive and my obeect madb eet without power to kill, or
change, or shun the fact  he likewise knew that to mankind he did long
dissemble  in some sort, did stillb  ut that thing of his dissembling
was only subeect to his perceptibility, not to his will determinateb
severtheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when
with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no santucketer thought him
otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the buick, with the
terrible casualty which had overtaken himb

Ihe report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
ascribed to a kindred causeb rnd so too, all the added moodiness which
always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the 
ebuod on the
present voyage, sat brooding on his browb sor is it so very unlikely,
that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on
account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent
isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he
was all the better bualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full
of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whalesb  nawed within and
scorched without, with the infised, unrelenting fangs of some incurable
idea  such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart
his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutesb
er, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,
yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on
his underlings to the attackb  ut be all this as it may, certain it is,
that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in
him, rhab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only
and allIengrossing obeect of hunting the uhite uhaleb  ad any one of his
old acbuaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him
then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the
ship from such a fiendish mans Ihey were bent on profitable cruises, the
profit to be counted down in dollars from the mintb  e was intent on an
audacious, immitigable, and supernatural revengeb

 ere, then, was this greyIheaded, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a
iob s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made
up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibalsIImorally enfeebled
also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or rightImindedness in
otarbuck, the invulnerable eollity of indifference and recklessness in
otubb, and the pervading mediocrity in rlaskb ouch a crew, so officered,
seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him
to his monomaniac revengeb  ow it was that they so aboundingly responded
to the old man s ireIIby what evil magic their souls were possessed,
that at times his hate seemed almost theirs  the uhite uhale as much
their insufferable foe as his  how all this came to beIIwhat the uhite
uhale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings, also, in

s r
Is   db Ihe uhiteness of Ihe uhaleb


uhat the white whale was to rhab, has been hinted  what, at times, he
was to me, as yet remains unsaidb

rside from those more obvious considerations touching  oby rick, which
could not but occasionally awaken in any man s soul some alarm, there
was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him,
which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest  and
yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that b almost despair of
putting it in a comprehensible formb bt was the whiteness of the whale
that above all things appalled meb  ut how can b hope to esplain myself
here  and yet, in some dim, random way, esplain myself b must, else all
these chapters might be naughtb

Ihough in many natural obeects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as
if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, eaponicas,
and pearls  and though various nations have in some way recognised a
certain royal preeminence in this hue  even the barbaric, grand old
kings of 
egu placing the title  rord of the uhite slephants  above all
their other magnilobuent ascriptions of dominion  and the modern kings
of oiam unfurling the same snowIwhite buadruped in the royal standard 
and the  anoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snowIwhite charger 
and the great rustrian smpire, saesarian, heir to overlording  ome,
having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue  and though this
preIeminence in it applies to the human race itself, giving the white
man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe  and though, besides, all
this, whiteness has been even made significant of gladness, for among
the  omans a white stone marked a eoyful day  and though in other mortal
sympathies and symbolicings, this same hue is made the emblem of many
touching, noble thingsIIthe innocence of brides, the benignity of age 
though among the  ed  en of rmerica the giving of the white belt
of wampum was the deepest pledge of honour  though in many climes,
whiteness typifies the maeesty of iustice in the ermine of the iudge,
and contributes to the daily state of kings and bueens drawn by
milkIwhite steeds  though even in the higher mysteries of the most
august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness
and power  by the 
ersian fire worshippers, the white forked flame being
held the holiest on the altar  and in the  reek mythologies,  reat iove
himself being made incarnate in a snowIwhite bull  and though to the
noble brobuois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred uhite rog was
by far the holiest festival of their theology, that spotless, faithful
creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the  reat opirit
with the annual tidings of their own fidelity  and though directly from
the ratin word for white, all shristian priests derive the name of
one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the
cassock  and though among the holy pomps of the  omish faith, white is
specially employed in the celebration of the 
assion of our rord  though
in the iision of otb iohn, white robes are given to the redeemed, and
the fourIandItwenty elders stand clothed in white before the greatIwhite
throne, and the  oly ene that sitteth there white like wool  yet for all
these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and honourable,
and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea
of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness
which affrights in bloodb

Ihis elusive buality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when
divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any obeect
terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest boundsb
uitness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics 
what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent
horrors they aren Ihat ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an
abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb
gloating of their aspectb oo that not the fierceIfanged tiger in his
heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the whiteIshrouded bear or
sharkbi


iuith reference to the 
olar bear, it may possibly be urged by him
who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not
the whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable
hideousness of that brute  for, analysed, that heightened hideousness,
it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the
irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the
fleece of celestial innocence and love  and hence, by bringing together
two such opposite emotions in our minds, the 
olar bear frightens us
with so unnatural a contrastb  ut even assuming all this to be true 
yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified
terrorb

rs for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that
creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the
same buality in the 
olar buadrupedb Ihis peculiarity is most vividly
hit by the rrench in the name they bestow upon that fishb Ihe  omish
mass for the dead begins with   ebuiem eternam  ieternal resti, whence
 sebbs  denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral musicb sow,
in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and
the mild deadliness of his habits, the rrench call him  sebbsb

wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all
imaginationsn sot soleridge first threw that spell  but  od s great,
unflattering laureate, saturebi


ib remember the first albatross b ever sawb bt was during a prolonged
gale, in waters hard upon the rntarctic seasb rrom my forenoon watch
below, b ascended to the overclouded deck  and there, dashed upon the
main hatches, b saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and
with a hooked,  oman bill sublimeb rt intervals, it arched forth
its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy arkb uondrous
flutterings and throbbings shook itb Ihough bodily unharmed, it uttered
cries, as some king s ghost in supernatural distressb Ihrough its
inespressible, strange eyes, methought b peeped to secrets which took
hold of  odb rs rbraham before the angels, b bowed myself  the white
thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever esiled
waters, b had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of
townsb rong b gaced at that prodigy of plumageb b cannot tell, can only
hint, the things that darted through me thenb  ut at last b awoke  and
turning, asked a sailor what bird was thisb r goney, he repliedb  oneys
never had heard that name before  is it conceivable that this glorious
thing is utterly unknown to men ashores nevers  ut some time after, b
learned that goney was some seaman s name for albatrossb oo that by no
possibility could soleridge s wild  hyme have had aught to do with those
mystical impressions which were mine, when b saw that bird upon our
deckb ror neither had b then read the  hyme, nor knew the bird to be
an albatrossb eet, in saying this, b do but indirectly burnish a little
brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poetb

b assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird
chiefly lurks the secret of the spell  a truth the more evinced in this,
that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses 
and these b have frebuently seen, but never with such emotions as when b
beheld the rntarctic fowlb

 ut how had the mystic thing been caughtn uhisper it not, and b will
tell  with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the seab
rt last the saptain made a postman of it  tying a lettered, leathern
tally round its neck, with the ship s time and place  and then letting
it escapeb  ut b doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was

 ost famous in our uestern annals and bndian traditions is that of
the uhite oteed of the 
rairies  a magnificent milkIwhite charger,
largeIeyed, smallIheaded, bluffIchested, and with the dignity of a
thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriageb  e was the
elected aerses of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those
days were only fenced by the  ocky  ountains and the rlleghaniesb rt
their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which
every evening leads on the hosts of lightb Ihe flashing cascade of his
mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more
resplendent than gold and silverIbeaters could have furnished himb r
most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western
world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the
glories of those primeval times when rdam walked maeestic as a god,
bluffIbrowed and fearless as this mighty steedb uhether marching amid
his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly
streamed it over the plains, like an ehio  or whether with his
circumambient subeects browsing all around at the horicon, the uhite
oteed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his
cool milkiness  in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the
bravest bndians he was the obeect of trembling reverence and aweb sor
can it be buestioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble
horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him
with divineness  and that this divineness had that in it which, though
commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain nameless terrorb

 ut there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that
accessory and strange glory which invests it in the uhite oteed and
rlbatrossb

uhat is it that in the rlbino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks
the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kins bt
is that whiteness which invests him, a thing espressed by the name
he bearsb Ihe rlbino is as well made as other menIIhas no substantive
deformityIIand yet this mere aspect of allIpervading whiteness makes him
more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortionb uhy should this be son

sor, in buite other aspects, does sature in her least palpable but
not the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces
this crowning attribute of the terribleb rrom its snowy aspect, the
gauntleted ghost of the oouthern oeas has been denominated the uhite
obuallb sor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice
omitted so potent an ausiliaryb  ow wildly it heightens the effect of
that passage in rroissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their
faction, the desperate uhite  oods of  hent murder their bailiff in the
marketIplaces

sor, in some things, does the common, hereditary esperience of all
mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hueb bt
cannot well be doubted, that the one visible buality in the aspect of
the dead which most appals the gacer, is the marble pallor lingering
there  as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of
consternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation hereb rnd
from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the espressive hue of the shroud
in which we wrap themb sor even in our superstitions do we fail to
throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms  all ghosts rising in a
milkIwhite fogIIeea, while these terrors seice us, let us add, that even
the king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on his
pallid horseb

Iherefore, in his other moods, symbolice whatever grand or gracious
thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest
idealiced significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soulb

 ut though without dissent this point be fised, how is mortal man to
account for itn Io analyse it, would seem impossibleb san we, then,
by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of
whitenessIIthough for the time either wholly or in great part stripped
of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful,
but nevertheless, is found to esert over us the same sorcery, however
modified IIcan we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us
to the hidden cause we seekn

ret us tryb  ut in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,
and without imagination no man can follow another into these hallsb rnd
though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about
to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were
entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able to
recall them nowb

uhy to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely
acbuainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare mention
of uhitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary, speechless
processions of slowIpacing pilgrims, downIcast and hooded with
newIfallen snown er, to the unread, unsophisticated 
rotestant of the
 iddle rmerican otates, why does the passing mention of a uhite rriar or
a uhite sun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the souln

er what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and
kings iwhich will not wholly account for iti that makes the uhite
Iower of rondon tell so much more strongly on the imagination of
an untravelled rmerican, than those other storied structures, its
neighborsIIthe  yward Iower, or even the  loodyn rnd those sublimer
towers, the uhite  ountains of sew  ampshire, whence, in peculiar moods,
comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of
that name, while the thought of iirginia s  lue  idge is full of a soft,
dewy, distant dreaminessn er why, irrespective of all latitudes and
longitudes, does the name of the uhite oea esert such a spectralness
over the fancy, while that of the eellow oea lulls us with mortal
thoughts of long lacbuered mild afternoons on the waves, followed by
the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsetsn er, to choose a wholly
unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy, why, in reading
the old fairy tales of sentral surope, does  the tall pale man  of the
 artc forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the
green of the grovesIIwhy is this phantom more terrible than all the
whooping imps of the  locksburgn

sor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedralItoppling
earthbuakes  nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas  nor the
tearlessness of arid skies that never rain  nor the sight of her wide
field of leaning spires, wrenched copeIstones, and crosses all adroop
ilike canted yards of anchored fleetsi  and her suburban avenues of
houseIwalls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of cards IIit
is not these things alone which make tearless rima, the strangest,
saddest city thou can st seeb ror rima has taken the white veil  and
there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woeb eld as 
icarro,
this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new  admits not the cheerful
greenness of complete decay  spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid
pallor of an apoplesy that fises its own distortionsb

b know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness
is not confessed to be the prime agent in esaggerating the terror of
obeects otherwise terrible  nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught
of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost
solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when eshibited under
any form at all approaching to muteness or universalityb uhat b mean
by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the
following esamplesb

rirstI Ihe mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by
night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels eust
enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties  but under precisely
similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to view his
ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whitenessIIas if from
encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round
him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread  the shrouded phantom
of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost  in vain the
lead assures him he is still off soundings  heart and helm they both go
down  he never rests till blue water is under him againb eet where is
the mariner who will tell thee,  oir, it was not so much the fear of
striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so
stirred men 

oecondI Io the native bndian of 
eru, the continual sight of the
snowhowdahed rndes conveys naught of dread, escept, perhaps, in the
mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast
altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be
to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudesb  uch the same is it with the
backwoodsman of the uest, who with comparative indifference views an
unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig
to break the fised trance of whitenessb sot so the sailor, beholding the
scenery of the rntarctic seas  where at times, by some infernal trick
of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and half
shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery,
views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean
ice monuments and splintered crossesb

 ut thou sayest, methinks that whiteIlead chapter about whiteness is but
a white flag hung out from a craven soul  thou surrenderest to a hypo,
bshmaelb

Iell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of
iermont, far removed from all beasts of preyIIwhy is it that upon the
sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that
he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskinessIIwhy
will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies
of affrightn Ihere is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild
creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange muskiness he
smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the esperience of
former perils  for what knows he, this sew sngland colt, of the black
bisons of distant eregonn

so  but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the
knowledge of the demonism in the worldb Ihough thousands of miles from
eregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring bison
herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies, which
this instant they may be trampling into dustb

Ihus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea  the bleak rustlings
of the festooned frosts of mountains  the desolate shiftings of the
windrowed snows of prairies  all these, to bshmael, are as the shaking
of that buffalo robe to the frightened colts

Ihough neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic
sign gives forth such hints  yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere
those things must esistb Ihough in many of its aspects this visible
world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in frightb

 ut not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and
learned why it appeals with such power to the soul  and more strange
and far more portentousIIwhy, as we have seen, it is at once the
most meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the
shristian s reity  and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent in
things the most appalling to mankindb

bs it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids
and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the
thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky
wayn er is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as
the visible absence of colour  and at the same time the concrete of all
colours  is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness,
full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snowsIIa colourless, allIcolour
of atheism from which we shrinkn rnd when we consider that other theory
of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly huesIIevery stately
or lovely emblaconingIIthe sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods  yea,
and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of
young girls  all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent
in substances, but only laid on from without  so that all deified sature
absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but
the charnelIhouse within  and when we proceed further, and consider that
the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great
principle of light, for ever remains white or colourless in itself, and
if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all obeects, even
tulips and roses, with its own blank tingeIIpondering all this, the
palsied universe lies before us a leper  and like wilful travellers in
rapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their
eyes, so the wretched infidel gaces himself blind at the monumental
white shroud that wraps all the prospect around himb rnd of all these
things the rlbino whale was the symbolb uonder ye then at the fiery

s r
Is    b Ihe shartb


 ad you followed saptain rhab down into his cabin after the sbuall that
took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose
with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom,
and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts, spread
them before him on his screwedIdown tableb Ihen seating himself before
it, you would have seen him intently study the various lines and
shadings which there met his eye  and with slow but steady pencil trace
additional courses over spaces that before were blankb rt intervals, he
would refer to piles of old logIbooks beside him, wherein were set down
the seasons and places in which, on various former voyages of various
ships, sperm whales had been captured or seenb

uhile thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his
head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever threw
shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it
almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses
on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and
courses upon the deeply marked chart of his foreheadb

 ut it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his
cabin, rhab thus pondered over his chartsb rlmost every night they were
brought out  almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and
others were substitutedb ror with the charts of all four oceans before
him, rhab was threading a mace of currents and eddies, with a view to
the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soulb

sow, to any one not fully acbuainted with the ways of the leviathans,
it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
creature in the unhooped oceans of this planetb  ut not so did it
seem to rhab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents  and thereby
calculating the driftings of the sperm whale s food  and, also, calling
to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular
latitudes  could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to
certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground
in search of his preyb

oo assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the
sperm whale s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that,
could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world  were the
logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated,
then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in
invariability to those of the herringIshoals or the flights of swallowsb
en this hint, attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory
charts of the sperm whalebi

     ioince the above was written, the statement is happily borne
     out by an official circular, issued by rieutenant  aury, of
     the sational ebservatory, uashington, rpril  ith,   d b  y
     that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in
     course of completion  and portions of it are presented in
     the circularb  Ihis chart divides the ocean into districts
     of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude 
     perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve
     columns for the twelve months  and horicontally through each
     of which districts are three lines  one to show the number
     of days that have been spent in each month in every
     district, and the two others to show the number of days in
     which whales, sperm or right, have been seenb 

 esides, when making a passage from one feedingIground to another, the
sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinctIIsay, rather, secret
intelligence from the reityIImostly swim in isbso, as they are called 
continuing their way along a given oceanIline with such undeviating
esactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with
one tithe of such marvellous precisionb Ihough, in these cases, the
direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor s parallel,
and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own
unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary isbs in which at these
times he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width
imore or less, as the vein is presumed to espand or contracti  but
never esceeds the visual sweep from the whaleIship s mastIheads,
when circumspectly gliding along this magic coneb Ihe sum is, that at
particular seasons within that breadth and along that path, migrating
whales may with great confidence be looked forb

rnd hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
feedingIgrounds, could rhab hope to encounter his prey  but in crossing
the widest espanses of water between those grounds he could, by his
art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly
without prospect of a meetingb

Ihere was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his
delirious but still methodical schemeb  ut not so in the reality,
perhapsb Ihough the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons
for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the
herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,
say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found
there the preceding season  though there are peculiar and unbuestionable
instances where the contrary of this has proved trueb bn general, the
same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries
and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whalesb oo that though  oby
rick had in a former year been seen, for esample, on what is called the
oeychelle ground in the bndian ocean, or iolcano  ay on the iapanese
soast  yet it did not follow, that were the 
ebuod to visit either of
those spots at any subsebuent corresponding season, she would infallibly
encounter him thereb oo, too, with some other feeding grounds, where
he had at times revealed himselfb  ut all these seemed only his casual
stoppingIplaces and oceanIinns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged
abodeb rnd where rhab s chances of accomplishing his obeect have
hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever
wayIside, antecedent, estra prospects were his, ere a particular
set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would become
probabilities, and, as rhab fondly thought, every possibility the nest
thing to a certaintyb Ihat particular set time and place were coneoined
in the one technical phraseIIthe oeasonIonItheIrineb ror there and then,
for several consecutive years,  oby rick had been periodically descried,
lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun, in its annual round,
loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the iodiacb Ihere
it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had
taken place  there the waves were storied with his deeds  there also was
that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive
to his vengeanceb  ut in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering
vigilance with which rhab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering
hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one
crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those
hopes  nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranbuillice his
unbuiet heart as to postpone all intervening buestb

sow, the 
ebuod had sailed from santucket at the very beginning of the
oeasonIonItheIrineb so possible endeavor then could enable her commander
to make the great passage southwards, double sape  orn, and then running
down sisty degrees of latitude arrive in the ebuatorial 
acific in time
to cruise thereb Iherefore, he must wait for the nest ensuing seasonb
eet the premature hour of the 
ebuod s sailing had, perhaps, been
correctly selected by rhab, with a view to this very complesion of
thingsb  ecause, an interval of three hundred and sistyIfive days
and nights was before him  an interval which, instead of impatiently
enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt  if by chance
the uhite uhale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his
periodical feedingIgrounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the

ersian  ulf, or in the  engal  ay, or shina oeas, or in any other

 ut granting all this  yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not
but a mad idea, this  that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary
whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual

deck he would seek to recover his strengthb rh,  ods what trances

eften, when forced from his hammock by eshausting and intolerably vivid
dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through
the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them
round and round and round in his blacing brain, till the very throbbing
of his lifeIspot became insufferable anguish  and when, as was sometimes
the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its
base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and
lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among
them  when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be
heard through the ship  and with glaring eyes rhab would burst from his
state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on fireb eet these,
perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent
weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens
of its intensityb ror, at such times, cracy rhab, the scheming,
unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale  this rhab that had
gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to burst from
it in horror againb Ihe latter was the eternal, living principle or
soul in him  and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the
charactericing mind, which at other times employed it for its outer
vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching
contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no
longer an integralb  ut as the mind does not esist unless leagued with
the soul, therefore it must have been that, in rhab s case, yielding up
all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose  that purpose,
by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and
devils into a kind of selfIassumed, independent being of its ownb say,
could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to which it was
coneoined, fled horrorIstricken from the unbidden and unfathered birthb
Iherefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when
what seemed rhab rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated
thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be
sure, but without an obeect to colour, and therefore a blankness in
itselfb  od help thee, old man, thy thoughts have created a creature
in thee  and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a

he createsb



s r
Is   db Ihe rffidavitb


oo far as what there may be of a narrative in this book  and, indeed, as
indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars
in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier
part, is as important a one as will be found in this volume  but the
leading matter of it rebuires to be still further and more familiarly
enlarged upon, in order to be adebuately understood, and moreover to
take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire
subeect may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity of the main
points of this affairb

b care not to perform this part of my task methodically  but shall
be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of
items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman  and from these
citations, b take itIIthe conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of
itselfb

rirstI b have personally known three instances where a whale, after
receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape  and, after an
interval iin one instance of three yearsi, has been again struck by
the same hand, and slain  when the two irons, both marked by the same
private cypher, have been taken from the bodyb bn the instance where
three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons  and b
think it may have been something more than that  the man who darted
them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to
rfrica, went ashore there, eoined a discovery party, and penetrated far
into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years,
often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas,
with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of
unknown regionsb  eanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have
been on its travels  no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,
brushing with its flanks all the coasts of rfrica  but to no purposeb
Ihis man and this whale again came together, and the one vanbuished the
otherb b say b, myself, have known three instances similar to this  that
is in two of them b saw the whales struck  and, upon the second attack,
saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards
taken from the dead fishb bn the threeIyear instance, it so fell out
that b was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last time
distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale s
eye, which b had observed there three years previousb b say three years,
but b am pretty sure it was more than thatb  ere are three instances,
then, which b personally know the truth of  but b have heard of many
other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no
good ground to impeachb

oecondlyI bt is well known in the operm uhale rishery, however ignorant
the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable
historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at
distant times and places popularly cognisableb uhy such a whale became
thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily
peculiarities as distinguished from other whales  for however peculiar
in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his
peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly
valuable oilb soI the reason was thisI that from the fatal esperiences
of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about
such a whale as there did about  inaldo  inaldini, insomuch that
most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their
tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,
without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acbuaintanceb rike some
poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man, they
make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they
pursued the acbuaintance further, they might receive a summary thump for
their presumptionb

 ut not only did each of these famous whales eneoy great individual
celebrityIIsay, you may call it an oceanIwide renown  not only was he
famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,
but he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions of
a name  had as much a name indeed as sambyses or saesarb uas it not so,
e Iimor Ioms thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so long
did st lurk in the eriental straits of that name, whose spout was oft
seen from the palmy beach of embayn uas it not so, e sew iealand iacks
thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of
the Iattoo randn uas it not so, e  orbuans ning of iapan, whose lofty
eet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snowIwhite cross
against the skyn uas it not so, e ron  iguels thou shilian whale, marked
like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the backs bn plain
prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of setacean
 istory as  arius or oylla to the classic scholarb

 ut this is not allb sew iealand Iom and ron  iguel, after at various
times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were
finally gone in buest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed
by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with
that espress obeect as much in view, as in setting out through the
sarragansett uoods, saptain  utler of old had it in his mind to capture
that notorious murderous savage rnnawon, the headmost warrior of the
bndian ning 
hilipb

b do not know where b can find a better place than eust here, to make
mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in
printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the
whole story of the uhite uhale, more especially the catastropheb ror
this is one of those disheartening instances where truth rebuires full
as much bolstering as errorb oo ignorant are most landsmen of some of
the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without
some hints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the
fishery, they might scout at  oby rick as a monstrous fable, or still
worse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegoryb

rirstI Ihough most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fised, vivid
conception of those perils, and the frebuency with which they recurb
ene reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and
deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at home,
however transient and immediately forgotten that recordb ro you suppose
that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by the
whaleIline off the coast of sew  uinea, is being carried down to the
bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathanIIdo you suppose that that
poor fellow s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read
toImorrow at your breakfastn soI because the mails are very irregular
between here and sew  uineab bn fact, did you ever hear what might be
called regular news direct or indirect from sew  uinean eet b tell you
that upon one particular voyage which b made to the 
acific, among many
others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a
death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each
lost a boat s crewb ror  od s sake, be economical with your lamps and
candless not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man s blood was
spilled for itb

oecondlyI 
eople ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is
an enormous creature of enormous power  but b have ever found that when
narrating to them some specific esample of this twoIfold enormousness,
they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness  when, b
declare upon my soul, b had no more idea of being facetious than  oses,
when he wrote the history of the plagues of sgyptb

 ut fortunately the special point b here seek can be established upon
testimony entirely independent of my ownb Ihat point is thisI Ihe operm
uhale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and eudiciously
malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and
sink a large ship  and what is more, the operm uhale  ro done itb

rirstI bn the year   dn the ship ssses, saptain 
ollard, of santucket,
was cruising in the 
acific eceanb ene day she saw spouts, lowered her
boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whalesb sre long, several of
the whales were wounded  when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping
from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the
shipb rashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in
less than  ten minutes  she settled down and fell overb sot a surviving
plank of her has been seen sinceb rfter the severest esposure, part of
the crew reached the land in their boatsb  eing returned home at last,
saptain 
ollard once more sailed for the 
acific in command of another
ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and
breakers  for the second time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith
forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it sinceb rt this day saptain

ollard is a resident of santucketb b have seen ewen shace, who was
chief mate of the ssses at the time of the tragedy  b have read his
plain and faithful narrative  b have conversed with his son  and all
this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophebi


iIhe following are estracts from shace s narrativeI  svery fact seemed
to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which
directed his operations  he made two several attacks upon the ship, at
a short interval between them, both of which, according to their
direction, were calculated to do us the most ineury, by being made
ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two obeects for the shock 
to effect which, the esact manoeuvres which he made were necessaryb  is
aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated resentment and furyb  e
came directly from the shoal which we had eust before entered, and in
which we had struck three of his companions, as if fired with revenge
for their sufferingsb  rgainI  rt all events, the whole circumstances
taken together, all happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the
time, impressions in my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the
part of the whale imany of which impressions b cannot now recalli,
induce me to be satisfied that b am correct in my opinionb 

 ere are his reflections some time after buitting the ship, during
a black night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any
hospitable shoreb  Ihe dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing  the
fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed
upon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subeects of fearful
contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment s thought  the
dismal looking wreck, and I s  e  br ro
ssI rsr  siss s er I s u rrs,
wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its appearanceb

oecondlyI Ihe ship bnion, also of santucket, was in the year   nd
totally lost off the rcores by a similar onset, but the authentic
particulars of this catastrophe b have never chanced to encounter,
though from the whale hunters b have now and then heard casual allusions
to itb

IhirdlyI oome eighteen or twenty years ago sommodore iIII, then
commanding an rmerican sloopIofIwar of the first class, happened to be
dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a santucket ship in
the harbor of eahu, oandwich bslandsb sonversation turning upon whales,
the sommodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amacing strength
ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen presentb  e peremptorily
denied for esample, that any whale could so smite his stout sloopIofIwar
as to cause her to leak so much as a thimblefulb iery good  but there
is more comingb oome weeks after, the sommodore set sail in this
impregnable craft for ialparaisob  ut he was stopped on the way by a
portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments  confidential business
with himb Ihat business consisted in fetching the sommodore s craft such
a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest
port to heave down and repairb b am not superstitious, but b consider
the sommodore s interview with that whale as providentialb uas not oaul
of Iarsus converted from unbelief by a similar frightn b tell you, the
sperm whale will stand no nonsenseb

b will now refer you to rangsdorff s ioyages for a little circumstance
in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereofb rangsdorff, you
must know by the way, was attached to the  ussian rdmiral nrusenstern s
famous riscovery sspedition in the beginning of the present centuryb
saptain rangsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapterI

  y the thirteenth of  ay our ship was ready to sail, and the nest day
we were out in the open sea, on our way to echotshb Ihe weather was very
clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on
our fur clothingb ror some days we had very little wind  it was not
till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang upb rn
uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself,
lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any
one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail,
was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking
against himb ue were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this
gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at
least out of the waterb Ihe masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether,
while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding
that we had struck upon some rock  instead of this we saw the monster
sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnityb saptain r uolf
applied immediately to the pumps to esamine whether or not the vessel
had received any damage from the shock, but we found that very happily
it had escaped entirely unineuredb 

sow, the saptain r uolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in
buestion, is a sew snglander, who, after a long life of unusual
adventures as a seaIcaptain, this day resides in the village of
rorchester near  ostonb b have the honour of being a nephew of hisb b
have particularly buestioned him concerning this passage in rangsdorffb
 e substantiates every wordb Ihe ship, however, was by no means a large
oneI a  ussian craft built on the oiberian coast, and purchased by my
uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from homeb

bn that up and down manly book of oldIfashioned adventure, so full, too,
of honest wondersIIthe voyage of rionel uafer, one of ancient rampier s
old chumsIIb found a little matter set down so like that eust buoted
from rangsdorff, that b cannot forbear inserting it here for a
corroborative esample, if such be neededb

rionel, it seems, was on his way to  iohn rerdinando,  as he calls
the modern iuan rernandesb  bn our way thither,  he says,  about four
o clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues
from the  ain of rmerica, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our
men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were
or what to think  but every one began to prepare for deathb rnd, indeed,
the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the
ship had struck against a rock  but when the amacement was a little
over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no groundbbbbb Ihe
suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages, and
several of the men were shaken out of their hammocksb saptain ravis, who
lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his cabins  rionel then
goes on to impute the shock to an earthbuake, and seems to substantiate
the imputation by stating that a great earthbuake, somewhere about
that time, did actually do great mischief along the opanish landb  ut
b should not much wonder if, in the darkness of that early hour of the
morning, the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically
bumping the hull from beneathb

b might proceed with several more esamples, one way or another known to
me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whaleb bn more
than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing
boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long
withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decksb Ihe snglish ship

usie  all can tell a story on that head  and, as for his strength,
let me say, that there have been esamples where the lines attached to a
running sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and
secured there  the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a
horse walks off with a cartb rgain, it is very often observed that, if
the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts,
not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of
destruction to his pursuers  nor is it without conveying some elobuent
indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will frebuently
open his mouth, and retain it in that dread espansion for several
consecutive minutesb  ut b must be content with only one more and a
concluding illustration  a remarkable and most significant one, by which
you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in
this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that these
marvels ilike all marvelsi are mere repetitions of the ages  so that for
the millionth time we say amen with oolomonIIierily there is nothing new
under the sunb

bn the sisth shristian century lived 
rocopius, a shristian magistrate
of sonstantinople, in the days when iustinian was smperor and  elisarius
generalb rs many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work
every way of uncommon valueb  y the best authorities, he has always been
considered a most trustworthy and unesaggerating historian, escept in
some one or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter presently
to be mentionedb

sow, in this history of his, 
rocopius mentions that, during the term
of his prefecture at sonstantinople, a great seaImonster was captured
in the neighboring 
ropontis, or oea of  armora, after having destroyed
vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty
yearsb r fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be
gainsaidb sor is there any reason it should beb ef what precise species
this seaImonster was, is not mentionedb  ut as he destroyed ships, as
well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale  and b am strongly
inclined to think a sperm whaleb rnd b will tell you whyb ror a long
time b fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the
 editerranean and the deep waters connecting with itb sven now b am
certain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the
present constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious
resortb  ut further investigations have recently proved to me, that in
modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the
sperm whale in the  editerraneanb b am told, on good authority, that
on the  arbary coast, a sommodore ravis of the  ritish navy found
the skeleton of a sperm whaleb sow, as a vessel of war readily passes
through the rardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route,
pass out of the  editerranean into the 
ropontisb

bn the 
ropontis, as far as b can learn, none of that peculiar substance
called   bI is to be found, the aliment of the right whaleb  ut b have
every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whaleIIsbuid or
cuttleIfishIIlurks at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures,
but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at its
surfaceb bf, then, you properly put these statements together, and
reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all
human reasoning, 
rocopius s seaImonster, that for half a century stove
the ships of a  oman smperor, must in all probability have been a sperm
whaleb



s r
Is   ib ourmisesb


Ihough, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, rhab in all his
thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of  oby rick 
though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one
passion  nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long
habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman s ways, altogether to
abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyageb er at least if
this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more
influential with himb bt would be refining too much, perhaps, even
considering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the
uhite uhale might have possibly estended itself in some degree to all
sperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he
multiplied the chances that each subsebuently encountered whale would
prove to be the hated one he huntedb  ut if such an hypothesis be indeed
esceptionable, there were still additional considerations which, though
not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet
were by no means incapable of swaying himb

Io accomplish his obeect rhab must use tools  and of all tools used in
the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of orderb  e knew,
for esample, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was
over otarbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual
man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual
mastership  for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in a
sort of corporeal relationb otarbuck s body and otarbuck s coerced will
were rhab s, so long as rhab kept his magnet at otarbuck s brain  still
he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his
captain s buest, and could he, would eoyfully disintegrate himself from
it, or even frustrate itb bt might be that a long interval would elapse
ere the uhite uhale was seenb ruring that long interval otarbuck
would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his
captain s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial
influences were brought to bear upon himb sot only that, but the subtle
insanity of rhab respecting  oby rick was noways more significantly
manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing
that, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that
strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it  that
the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure
background ifor few men s courage is proof against protracted meditation
unrelieved by actioni  that when they stood their long night watches,
his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than  oby
rickb ror however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the
announcement of his buest  yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less
capricious and unreliableIIthey live in the varying outer weather, and
they inhale its ficklenessIIand when retained for any obeect remote and
blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and passion in the
end, it is above all things rebuisite that temporary interests and
employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the
final dashb

sor was rhab unmindful of another thingb bn times of strong emotion
mankind disdain all base considerations  but such times are evanescentb
Ihe permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought
rhab, is sordidnessb  ranting that the uhite uhale fully incites the
hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even
breeds a certain generous knightIerrantism in them, still, while for the
love of it they give chase to  oby rick, they must also have food
for their more common, daily appetitesb ror even the high lifted and
chivalric srusaders of old times were not content to traverse two
thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without
committing burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious
perbuisites by the wayb  ad they been strictly held to their one final
and romantic obeectIIthat final and romantic obeect, too many would have
turned from in disgustb b will not strip these men, thought rhab, of all
hopes of cashIIaye, cashb Ihey may scorn cash now  but let some months
go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this same
buiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would soon
cashier rhabb

sor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related
to rhab personallyb  aving impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps
somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the

ebuod s voyage, rhab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing,
he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of
usurpation  and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew
if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further
obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the commandb rrom
even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible
consebuences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, rhab must
of course have been most ansious to protect himselfb Ihat protection
could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand,
backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute
atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subeected
tob

ror all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be
verbally developed here, rhab plainly saw that he must still in a good
degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the 
ebuod s
voyage  observe all customary usages  and not only that, but force
himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general
pursuit of his professionb

 e all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three
mastIheads and admonishing them to keep a bright lookIout, and not omit
reporting even a porpoiseb Ihis vigilance was not long without rewardb

bt was a cloudy, sultry afternoon  the seamen were lacily lounging
about the decks, or vacantly gacing over into the leadIcoloured watersb
eueebueg and b were mildly employed weaving what is called a swordImat,
for an additional lashing to our boatb oo still and subdued and yet
somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie
lurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own
invisible selfb

b was the attendant or page of eueebueg, while busy at the matb rs b
kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between
the long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as
eueebueg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword
between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and
unthinkingly drove home every yarnI b say so strange a dreaminess did
there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only broken by
the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were
the room of Iime, and b myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving
and weaving away at the ratesb Ihere lay the fised threads of the warp
subeect to but one single, ever returning, unchanging vibration, and
that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending
of other threads with its ownb Ihis warp seemed necessity  and here,

necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though
thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the
last featuring blow at eventsb


Ihus we were weaving and weaving away when b started at a sound so
strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball
of free will dropped from my hand, and b stood gacing up at the clouds
whence that voice dropped like a wingb  igh aloft in the crossItrees was
that mad  ayI eader, Iashtegob  is body was reaching eagerly forward,
his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden intervals he
continued his criesb Io be sure the same sound was that very moment
perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of whalemen s
lookIouts perched as high in the air  but from few of those lungs could
that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from
Iashtego the bndian sb

rs he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and
eagerly peering towards the horicon, you would have thought him some
prophet or seer beholding the shadows of rate, and by those wild cries
announcing their comingb

Ihe ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling
before itb Iashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to
leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of
our bowsb ror that singular craft at times evinced by the operm uhale
when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while
concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in the
opposite buarterIIthis deceitfulness of his could not now be in action 
for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Iashtego had
been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our vicinityb ene of
the men selected for shipkeepersIIthat is, those not appointed to the
boats, by this time relieved the bndian at the mainImast headb Ihe
sailors at the fore and miccen had come down  the line tubs were fised
in their places  the cranes were thrust out  the mainyard was backed,
and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over
high cliffsb eutside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand
clung to the rail, while one foot was espectantly poised on the gunwaleb
oo look the long line of manIofIwar s men about to throw themselves on
board an enemy s shipb

 ut at this critical instant a sudden esclamation was heard that took
every eye from the whaleb uith a start all glared at dark rhab, who was
surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of airb



s r
Is    b Ihe rirst roweringb


Ihe phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side
of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the
tackles and bands of the boat which swung thereb Ihis boat had always
been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called the
captain s, on account of its hanging from the starboard buarterb Ihe
figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white
tooth evilly protruding from its steelIlike lipsb r rumpled shinese
eacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers
of the same dark stuffb  ut strangely crowning this ebonness was a
glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and coiled
round and round upon his headb ress swart in aspect, the companions of
this figure were of that vivid, tigerIyellow complesion peculiar to
some of the aboriginal natives of the  anillas IIa race notorious for
a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white mariners
supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the
water of the devil, their lord, whose countingIroom they suppose to be
elsewhereb

uhile yet the wondering ship s company were gacing upon these strangers,
rhab cried out to the whiteIturbaned old man at their head,  rll ready
there, redallahn 

  eady,  was the halfIhissed replyb

 rower away then  d ye hearn  shouting across the deckb  rower away
there, b sayb 

ouch was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amacement the men
sprang over the rail  the sheaves whirled round in the blocks  with a
wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea  while, with a desterous,
offIhanded daring, unknown in any other vocation, the sailors,
goatIlike, leaped down the rolling ship s side into the tossed boats
belowb

 ardly had they pulled out from under the ship s lee, when a fourth
keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and
showed the five strangers rowing rhab, who, standing erect in the stern,
loudly hailed otarbuck, otubb, and rlask, to spread themselves widely,
so as to cover a large espanse of waterb  ut with all their eyes again
riveted upon the swart redallah and his crew, the inmates of the other
boats obeyed not the commandb

otubb s esordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had
rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in
inculcating the religion of rowingb  ut you must not suppose from this
specimen of his sermonicings that he ever flew into downright passions
with his congregationb sot at all  and therein consisted his chief
peculiarityb  e would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a
tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so
calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear such
bueer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling for
the mere eoke of the thingb  esides he all the time looked so easy and
indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steeringIoar, and so broadly
gapedIIopenImouthed at timesIIthat the mere sight of such a yawning
commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crewb
Ihen again, otubb was one of those odd sort of humorists, whose eollity
is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their
guard in the matter of obeying themb

bn obedience to a sign from rhab, otarbuck was now pulling oblibuely
across otubb s bow  and when for a minute or so the two boats were
pretty near to each other, otubb hailed the mateb

  rb otarbucks larboard boat there, ahoys a word with ye, sir, if ye
pleases 

  alloas  returned otarbuck, turning round not a single inch as he
spoke  still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew  his face set
like a flint from otubb sb

sow the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant
as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably
awakened a sort of superstitious amacement in some of the ship s
company  but rrchy s fancied discovery having some time previous got
abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some
small measure prepared them for the eventb bt took off the estreme edge
of their wonder  and so what with all this and otubb s confident way
of accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from
superstitious surmisings  though the affair still left abundant room for
all manner of wild coneectures as to dark rhab s precise agency in the
matter from the beginningb ror me, b silently recalled the mysterious
shadows b had seen creeping on board the 
ebuod during the dim santucket
dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable slieahb

 eantime, rhab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the
furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats  a
circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling himb Ihose tiger
yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone  like five
tripIhammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which
periodically started the boat along the water like a horicontal burst
boiler out of a  ississippi steamerb rs for redallah, who was seen
pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black eacket, and
displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the
gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery
horicon  while at the other end of the boat rhab, with one arm, like a
fencer s, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance any
tendency to trip  rhab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in
a thousand boat lowerings ere the uhite uhale had torn himb rll at once
the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fised,
while the boat s five oars were seen simultaneously peakedb  oat and
crew sat motionless on the seab bnstantly the three spread boats in the
rear paused on their wayb Ihe whales had irregularly settled bodily
down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the
movement, though from his closer vicinity rhab had observed itb

 svery man look out along his oarss  cried otarbuckb  Ihou, eueebueg,
stand ups 

simbly springing up on the triangular raised bos in the bow, the savage
stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gaced off towards the
spot where the chase had last been descriedb rikewise upon the estreme
stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with
the gunwale, otarbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing
himself to the eerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently
eyeing the vast blue eye of the seab

sot very far distant rlask s boat was also lying breathlessly still  its
commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout
sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the
level of the stern platformb bt is used for catching turns with the
whale lineb bts top is not more spacious than the palm of a man s hand,
and standing upon such a base as that, rlask seemed perched at the
mastIhead of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucksb  ut little
ningI
ost was small and short, and at the same time little ningI
ost was
full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead standIpoint
of his did by no means satisfy ningI
ostb

 b can t see three seas off  tip us up an oar there, and let me on to
thatb 

bpon this, raggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his
way, swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty
shoulders for a pedestalb

  ood a mastIhead as any, sirb uill you mountn 

 Ihat b will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow  only b wish you
fifty feet tallerb 

uhereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the
boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to
rlask s foot, and then putting rlask s hand on his hearseIplumed head
and bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one desterous
fling landed the little man high and dry on his shouldersb rnd here was
rlask now standing, raggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a
breastband to lean against and steady himself byb

rt any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous
habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect
posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously
perverse and crossIrunning seasb otill more strange to see him giddily
perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstancesb  ut the
sight of little rlask mounted upon gigantic raggoo was yet more curious 
for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of,
barbaric maeesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously
rolled his fine formb en his broad back, flasenIhaired rlask seemed
a snowIflakeb Ihe bearer looked nobler than the riderb Ihough truly
vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little rlask would now and then
stamp with impatience  but not one added heave did he thereby give to
the negro s lordly chestb oo have b seen 
assion and ianity stamping the
living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her
seasons for thatb

 eanwhile otubb, the third mate, betrayed no such farIgacing
solicitudesb Ihe whales might have made one of their regular soundings,
not a temporary dive from mere fright  and if that were the case,
otubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the
languishing interval with his pipeb  e withdrew it from his hatband,
where he always wore it aslant like a featherb  e loaded it, and rammed
home the loading with his thumbIend  but hardly had he ignited his match
across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Iashtego, his harpooneer,
whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fised stars, suddenly
dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat, crying out in a
buick phrensy of hurry,  rown, down all, and give waysIIthere they ares 

Io a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been
visible at that moment  nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
water, and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it, and
suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white
rolling billowsb Ihe air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it
were, like the air over intensely heated plates of ironb  eneath this
atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of
water, also, the whales were swimmingb oeen in advance of all the other
indications, the puffs of vapour they spouted, seemed their forerunning
couriers and detached flying outridersb

rll four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled
water and airb  ut it bade fair to outstrip them  it flew on and on,
as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the
hillsb

 
ull, pull, my good boys,  said otarbuck, in the lowest possible but
intensest concentrated whisper to his men  while the sharp fised glance
from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two
visible needles in two unerring binnacle compassesb  e did not say much
to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to himb enly the
silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his
peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreatyb

head, and stamped up and down on it  then picking it up, flirted it far
off upon the sea  and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat s
stern like a craced colt from the prairieb

unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a

 ut what it was that inscrutable rhab said to that tigerIyellow crew of
hisIIthese were words best omitted here  for you live under the blessed
light of the evangelical landb enly the infidel sharks in the audacious
seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of
red murder, and foamIglued lips, rhab leaped after his preyb

 eanwhile, all the boats tore onb Ihe repeated specific allusions of
rlask to  that whale,  as he called the fictitious monster which
he declared to be incessantly tantalicing his boat s bow with its
tailIIthese allusions of his were at times so vivid and lifeIlike, that
they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look
over the shoulderb  ut this was against all rule  for the oarsmen
must put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks  usage
pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but
arms, in these critical momentsb

bt was a sight full of buick wonder and awes Ihe vast swells of the
omnipotent sea  the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled along
the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowlingIgreen 
the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on
the knifeIlike edge of the sharper waves, that almost seemed threatening
to cut it in two  the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and
hollows  the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite
hill  the headlong, sledIlike slide down its other side IIall these,
with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps
of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the ivory 
ebuod bearing
down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her
screaming brood IIall this was thrillingb

sot the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever
heat of his first battle  not the dead man s ghost encountering the
first unknown phantom in the other world IIneither of these can feel
stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first
time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the
hunted sperm whaleb

Ihe dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more
visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloudIshadows
flung upon the seab Ihe eets of vapour no longer blended, but tilted
everywhere to right and left  the whales seemed separating their wakesb
Ihe boats were pulled more apart  otarbuck giving chase to three whales
running dead to leewardb eur sail was now set, and, with the still
rising wind, we rushed along  the boat going with such madness through
the water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to
escape being torn from the rowIlocksb

ooon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist  neither ship
nor boat to be seenb

  ive way, men,  whispered otarbuck, drawing still further aft the sheet
of his sail   there is time to kill a fish yet before the sbuall comesb
Ihere s white water againsIIclose tos oprings 

ooon after, two cries in buick succession on each side of us denoted
that the other boats had got fast  but hardly were they overheard, when
with a lightningIlike hurtling whisper otarbuck saidI  otand ups  and
eueebueg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feetb

Ihough not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril
so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance
of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent
instant had come  they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of
fifty elephants stirring in their litterb  eanwhile the boat was still
booming through the mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like
the erected crests of enraged serpentsb

 Ihat s his humpb I s s, I s s, give it to hims  whispered otarbuckb

r short rushing sound leaped out of the boat  it was the darted iron of
eueebuegb Ihen all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from
astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge  the sail
collapsed and esploded  a gush of scalding vapour shot up near by 
something rolled and tumbled like an earthbuake beneath usb Ihe whole
crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helterIskelter into the
white curdling cream of the sbuallb obuall, whale, and harpoon had all
blended together  and the whale, merely graced by the iron, escapedb

Ihough completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmedb owimming round
it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,
tumbled back to our placesb Ihere we sat up to our knees in the sea, the
water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gacing eyes
the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom
of the oceanb

Ihe wind increased to a howl  the waves dashed their bucklers together 
the whole sbuall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white
fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning  immortal
in these eaws of deaths bn vain we hailed the other boats  as well roar
to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those
boats in that stormb  eanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew
darker with the shadows of night  no sign of the ship could be seenb
Ihe rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boatb Ihe oars were
useless as propellers, performing now the office of lifeIpreserversb
oo, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many failures
otarbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern  then stretching
it on a waif pole, handed it to eueebueg as the standardIbearer of this
forlorn hopeb Ihere, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in
the heart of that almighty forlornnessb Ihere, then, he sat, the sign
and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in the
midst of despairb

uet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat,
we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came onb Ihe mist still spread over
the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boatb
ouddenly eueebueg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his earb
ue all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by
the stormb Ihe sound came nearer and nearer  the thick mists were dimly
parted by a huge, vague formb rffrighted, we all sprang into the sea as
the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us within a
distance of not much more than its lengthb

rloating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it
tossed and gaped beneath the ship s bows like a chip at the base of a
cataract  and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no
more till it came up weltering asternb rgain we swam for it, were dashed
against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely landed on
boardb sre the sbuall came close to, the other boats had cut loose from
their fish and returned to the ship in good timeb Ihe ship had given us
up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon some token of
our perishing,IIan oar or a lance poleb

Ihere are certain bueer times and occasions in this strange mised affair
we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical

suspects that the eoke is at nobody s espense but his ownb  owever,
nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputingb  e bolts

difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril of
life and limb  all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly,
goodInatured hits, and eolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen
and unaccountable old eokerb Ihat odd sort of wayward mood b am speaking
of, comes over a man only in some time of estreme tribulation  it comes
in the very midst of his earnestness, so that what eust before might
have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part of the
general eokeb Ihere is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this
free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy  and with it b now
regarded this whole voyage of the 
ebuod, and the great uhite uhale its
obeectb

and b was still shaking myself in my eacket to fling off the water 
 eueebueg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often happenn 
uithout much emotion, though soaked through eust like me, he gave me to

of the entire caseb sonsidering, therefore, that sbualls and capsicings
in the water and consebuent bivouacks on the deep, were matters
of common occurrence in this kind of life  considering that at the
superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale b must resign my
life into the hands of him who steered the boatIIoftentimes a fellow who
at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling
the craft with his own frantic stampings  considering that the
particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed
to otarbuck s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a sbuall,
and considering that otarbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his
great heedfulness in the fishery  considering that b belonged to this
uncommonly prudent otarbuck s boat  and finally considering in what a
devil s chase b was implicated, touching the uhite uhaleI taking all
things together, b say, b thought b might as well go below and make a
rough draft of my willb  eueebueg,  said b,  come along, you shall be my

round me tranbuilly and contentedly, like a buiet ghost with a clean

rmong whaleIwise people it has often been argued whether, considering
the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it is
right for a whaling captain to eeopardice that life in the active perils
of the chaseb oo Iamerlane s soldiers often argued with tears in their
eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the
thickest of the fightb

 ut with rhab the buestion assumed a modified aspectb sonsidering
that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger 
considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and
estraordinary difficulties  that every individual moment, indeed, then
comprises a peril  under these circumstances is it wise for any
maimed man to enter a whaleIboat in the huntn rs a general thing, the
eointIowners of the 
ebuod must have plainly thought notb

rhab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of
his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of
the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving
his orders in person, yet for saptain rhab to have a boat actually
apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the huntIIabove all for
saptain rhab to be supplied with five estra men, as that same boat s
crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads
of the owners of the 
ebuodb Iherefore he had not solicited a boat s
crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that headb
severtheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all
that matterb bntil sabaco s published discovery, the sailors had little
foreseen it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out
of port, all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the
whaleboats for service  when some time after this rhab was now and then
found bestirring himself in the matter of making tholeIpins with his
own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even
solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is
running out are pinned over the groove in the bowI when all this was
observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an estra
coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better
withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb  and also the ansiety
he evinced in esactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is
sometimes called, the horicontal piece in the boat s bow for bracing the
knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale  when it was observed
how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fised in the
semiIcircular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter s chisel
gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there  all these
things, b say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at the timeb  ut
almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness
in rhab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of  oby rick 
for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster
in personb  ut such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest
suspicion as to any boat s crew being assigned to that boatb

sow, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned
away  for in a whaler wonders soon waneb  esides, now and then such
unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown
nooks and ashIholes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of
whalers  and the ships themselves often pick up such bueer castaway
creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck,
oars, whaleboats, canoes, blownIoff iapanese eunks, and what not  that
 eelcebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin
to chat with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable
escitement in the forecastleb

 ut be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate
phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were
somehow distinct from them, yet that hairIturbaned redallah remained
a muffled mystery to the lastb uhence he came in a mannerly world like
this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be
linked with rhab s peculiar fortunes  nay, so far as to have some sort
of a halfIhinted influence   eaven knows, but it might have been even
authority over him  all this none knewb  ut one cannot sustain
an indifferent air concerning redallahb  e was such a creature as
civiliced, domestic people in the temperate cone only see in their
dreams, and that but dimly  but the like of whom now and then glide
among the unchanging rsiatic communities, especially the eriental isles
to the east of the continentIIthose insulated, immemorial, unalterable
countries, which even in these modern days still preserve much of the
ghostly aboriginalness of earth s primal generations, when the memory of
the first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his descendants,
unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real phantoms, and asked of
the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end  when though,
according to  enesis, the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of
men, the devils also, add the uncanonical  abbins, indulged in mundane
amoursb

rays, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory 
ebuod had slowly
swept across four several cruisingIgrounds  that off the rcores  off the
sape de ierdes  on the 
late iso calledi, being off the mouth of the
 io de la 
lata  and the sarrol  round, an unstaked, watery locality,
southerly from otb  elenab

bt was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and
moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver 
and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery
silence, not a solitude  on such a silent night a silvery eet was seen
far in advance of the white bubbles at the bowb rit up by the moon, it
looked celestial  seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from
the seab redallah first descried this eetb ror of these moonlight
nights, it was his wont to mount to the mainImast head, and stand a
lookIout there, with the same precision as if it had been dayb rnd yet,
though herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a hundred
would venture a lowering for themb eou may think with what emotions,
then, the seamen beheld this old eriental perched aloft at such unusual
hours  his turban and the moon, companions in one skyb  ut when, after
spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights
without uttering a single sound  when, after all this silence, his
unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moonIlit eet, every
reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had
lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crewb  Ihere she blowss 
 ad the trump of eudgment blown, they could not have buivered more  yet
still they felt no terror  rather pleasureb ror though it was a most
unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously
esciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a
loweringb

ualking the deck with buick, sideIlunging strides, rhab commanded the
t gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spreadb Ihe
best man in the ship must take the helmb Ihen, with every mastIhead
manned, the piledIup craft rolled down before the windb Ihe strange,
upheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breece filling the hollows
of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air
beneath the feet  while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic
influences were struggling in herIIone to mount direct to heaven, the
other to drive yawingly to some horicontal goalb rnd had you watched
rhab s face that night, you would have thought that in him also two
different things were warringb uhile his one live leg made lively echoes
along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffinItapb
en life and death this old man walkedb  ut though the ship so swiftly
sped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager glances shot,
yet the silvery eet was no more seen that nightb svery sailor swore he
saw it once, but not a second timeb

Ihis midnightIspout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days
after, los at the same silent hour, it was again announcedI again it
was descried by all  but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it
disappeared as if it had never beenb rnd so it served us night after
night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at itb  ysteriously
eetted into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be 
disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three  and somehow
seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and
further in our van, this solitary eet seemed for ever alluring us onb

sor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance
with the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested
the 
ebuod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that
whenever and wherever descried  at however remote times, or in however
far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast
by one selfIsame whale  and that whale,  oby rickb ror a time, there
reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition,
as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the
monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest
and most savage seasb

Ihese temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous
potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in which, beneath
all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as
for days and days we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely
mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed
vacating itself of life before our urnIlike prowb

 ut, at last, when turning to the eastward, the sape winds began howling
around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas that are
there  when the ivoryItusked 
ebuod sharply bowed to the blast, and
gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of silver chips,
the foamIflakes flew over her bulwarks  then all this desolate vacuity
of life went away, but gave place to sights more dismal than beforeb

slose to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither
before us  while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable seaIravensb rnd
every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen  and
spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp,
as though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft  a thing
appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roostingIplace for their
homeless selvesb rnd heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the
black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience  and the great mundane
soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had
bredb

sape of  ood  ope, do they call yen  ather sape Iormentoto, as called
of yore  for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had
attended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea,
where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed
condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat
that black air without any horiconb  ut calm, snowIwhite, and unvarying 
still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky  still beckoning us
on from before, the solitary eet would at times be descriedb

ruring all this blackness of the elements, rhab, though assuming for the
time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck,
manifested the gloomiest reserve  and more seldom than ever addressed
his matesb bn tempestuous times like these, after everything above and
aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but passively to await
the issue of the galeb Ihen saptain and crew become practical fatalistsb
oo, with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole, and with one
hand firmly grasping a shroud, rhab for hours and hours would stand
gacing dead to windward, while an occasional sbuall of sleet or snow
would all but congeal his very eyelashes togetherb  eantime, the crew
driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that
burstingly broke over its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in
the waist  and the better to guard against the leaping waves, each man
had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which
he swung as in a loosened beltb rew or no words were spoken  and the
silent ship, as if manned by painted sailors in was, day after day tore
on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac wavesb
 y night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the
ocean prevailed  still in silence the men swung in the bowlines  still
wordless rhab stood up to the blastb sven when wearied nature seemed
demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammockb sever
could otarbuck forget the old man s aspect, when one night going down
into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw him with
closed eyes sitting straight in his floorIscrewed chair  the rain
and halfImelted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before
emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coatb en the
table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents
which have previously been spoken ofb  is lantern swung from his tightly
clenched handb Ihough the body was erect, the head was thrown back so
that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tellItale
that swung from a beam in the ceilingbi


iIhe cabinIcompass is called the tellItale, because without going to the
compass at the helm, the saptain, while below, can inform himself of the
course of the shipb

oouthIeastward from the sape, off the distant srocetts, a good cruising
ground for  ight uhalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the  oney irlbatrossi
by nameb rs she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the
foreImastIhead, b had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro
in the far ocean fisheriesIIa whaler at sea, and long absent from homeb

rs if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the
skeleton of a stranded walrusb rll down her sides, this spectral
appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all her
spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over
with hoarIfrostb enly her lower sails were setb r wild sight it was to
see her longIbearded lookIouts at those three mastIheadsb Ihey seemed
clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment that had
survived nearly four years of cruisingb otanding in iron hoops nailed to
the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea  and though, when
the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we sis men in the air
came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the
mastIheads of one ship to those of the other  yet, those forlornIlooking
fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own
lookIouts, while the buarterIdeck hail was being heard from belowb

 ohip ahoys  ave ye seen the uhite uhalen 

 ut as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in the
act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his hand
into the sea  and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to make
himself heard without itb  eantime his ship was still increasing the
distance betweenb uhile in various silent ways the seamen of the 
ebuod
were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first
mere mention of the uhite uhale s name to another ship, rhab for a
moment paused  it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat
to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbadeb  ut taking
advantage of his windward position, he again seiced his trumpet, and
knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a santucketer and
shortly bound home, he loudly hailedII rhoy theres Ihis is the 
ebuod,
bound round the worlds Iell them to address all future letters to the

acific oceans and this time three years, if b am not at home, tell them
to address them toII 

rt that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then,
in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish,
that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side, darted
away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves fore and
aft with the stranger s flanksb Ihough in the course of his continual
voyagings rhab must often before have noticed a similar sight, yet, to
any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously carry meaningsb

 owim away from me, do yen  murmured rhab, gacing over into the waterb
Ihere seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep
helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evincedb  ut
turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the
wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,II bp
helms neep her off round the worlds 

 ound the worlds Ihere is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings 
but whereto does all that circumnavigation conductn enly through
numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that
we left behind secure, were all the time before usb

uere this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for
ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange
than any syclades or bslands of ning oolomon, then there were promise
in the voyageb  ut in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in
tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims
before all human hearts  while chasing such over this round globe, they
either lead us on in barren maces or midway leave us whelmedb



s r
Is  d b Ihe  amb


Ihe ostensible reason why rhab did not go on board of the whaler we had
spoken was thisI the wind and sea betokened stormsb  ut even had
this not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded
herIIeudging by his subsebuent conduct on similar occasionsIIif so it
had been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative
answer to the buestion he putb ror, as it eventually turned out, he
cared not to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain,
escept he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly
soughtb  ut all this might remain inadebuately estimated, were not
something said here of the peculiar usages of whalingIvessels when
meeting each other in foreign seas, and especially on a common
cruisingIgroundb

bf two strangers crossing the 
ine  arrens in sew eork otate, or the
ebually desolate oalisbury 
lain in sngland  if casually encountering
each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of
them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation  and stopping for a moment
to interchange the news  and, perhaps, sitting down for a while
and resting in concertI then, how much more natural that upon the
illimitable 
ine  arrens and oalisbury 
lains of the sea, two whaling
vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earthIIoff lone
ranning s bsland, or the far away ning s  ills  how much more natural,
b say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only
interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and
sociable contactb rnd especially would this seem to be a matter of
course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose captains,
officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to each other 
and consebuently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk aboutb

ror the long absent ship, the outwardIbounder, perhaps, has letters on
board  at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a
date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumbIworn
filesb rnd in return for that courtesy, the outwardIbound ship would
receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruisingIground to
which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost importance to herb rnd
in degree, all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing
each other s track on the cruisingIground itself, even though they
are ebually long absent from homeb ror one of them may have received a
transfer of letters from some third, and now far remote vessel  and
some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meetsb
 esides, they would eschange the whaling news, and have an agreeable
chatb ror not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors,
but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common
pursuit and mutually shared privations and perilsb

sor would difference of country make any very essential difference 
that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case
with rmericans and snglishb Ihough, to be sure, from the small number of
snglish whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when they
do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them  for your
snglishman is rather reserved, and your eankee, he does not fancy that
sort of thing in anybody but himselfb  esides, the snglish whalers
sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the rmerican
whalers  regarding the long, lean santucketer, with his nondescript
provincialisms, as a sort of seaIpeasantb  ut where this superiority
in the snglish whalemen does really consist, it would be hard to say,
seeing that the eankees in one day, collectively, kill more whales than
all the snglish, collectively, in ten yearsb  ut this is a harmless
little foible in the snglish whaleIhunters, which the santucketer does
not take much to heart  probably, because he knows that he has a few
foibles himselfb

oo, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the
whalers have most reason to be sociableIIand they are sob uhereas, some
merchant ships crossing each other s wake in the midIrtlantic, will
oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,
mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies in
 roadway  and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism upon
each other s rigb rs for  enIofIuar, when they chance to meet at sea,
they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings, such
a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much rightIdown
hearty goodIwill and brotherly love about it at allb rs touching
olaveIships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry, they run
away from each other as soon as possibleb rnd as for 
irates, when they
chance to cross each other s crossIbones, the first hail isII  ow many
skullsn IIthe same way that whalers hailII  ow many barrelsn  rnd that
buestion once answered, pirates straightway steer apart, for they are
infernal villains on both sides, and don t like to see overmuch of each
other s villanous likenessesb

 ut look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,
freeIandIeasy whalers uhat does the whaler do when she meets another
whaler in any sort of decent weathern ohe has a   r ,  a thing so
utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name
even  and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it, and
repeat gamesome stuff about  spouters  and  blubberIboilers,  and such
like pretty esclamationsb uhy it is that all  erchantIseamen, and also
all 
irates and  anIofIuar s men, and olaveIship sailors, cherish such
a scornful feeling towards uhaleIships  this is a buestion it would be
hard to answerb  ecause, in the case of pirates, say, b should like to
know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about
itb bt sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed  but only at the
gallowsb rnd besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has
no proper foundation for his superior altitudeb  ence, b conclude,
that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman, in that
assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand onb

 ut what is a  r n eou might wear out your indesIfinger running up and
down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the wordb rrb iohnson
never attained to that erudition  soah uebster s ark does not hold itb
severtheless, this same espressive word has now for many years been in
constant use among some fifteen thousand true born eankeesb sertainly,
it needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the resiconb uith
that view, let me learnedly define itb

Ihere is another little item about  amming which must not be forgotten
hereb rll professions have their own little peculiarities of detail  so
has the whale fisheryb bn a pirate, manIofIwar, or slave ship, when
the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern
sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often
steers himself with a pretty little milliner s tiller decorated with
gay cords and ribbonsb  ut the whaleIboat has no seat astern, no sofa of
that sort whatever, and no tiller at allb  igh times indeed, if whaling
captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen
in patent chairsb rnd as for a tiller, the whaleIboat never admits of
any such effeminacy  and therefore as in gamming a complete boat s crew
must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of
the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and
the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit
all standing like a pine treeb rnd often you will notice that being
conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from
the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the
importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legsb sor is
this any very easy matter  for in his rear is the immense proeecting
steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the
afterIoar reciprocating by rapping his knees in frontb  e is thus
completely wedged before and behind, and can only espand himself
sideways by settling down on his stretched legs  but a sudden, violent
pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of
foundation is nothing without corresponding breadthb  erely make a
spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them upb Ihen, again,
it would never do in plain sight of the world s riveted eyes, it would
never do, b say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying
himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with
his hands  indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant selfIcommand, he
generally carries his hands in his trowsers  pockets  but perhaps being
generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballastb
severtheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated ones too,
where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or
two, in a sudden sbuall sayIIto seice hold of the nearest oarsman s
hair, and hold on there like grim deathb

story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain
wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called eudgments of  od
which at times are said to overtake some menb Ihis latter circumstance,
with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may be called the
secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the ears
of saptain rhab or his matesb ror that secret part of the story was
unknown to the captain of the IownI o himselfb bt was the private
property of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it
seems, communicated it to Iashtego with  omish ineunctions of secrecy,
but the following night Iashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed
so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could not well
withhold the restb severtheless, so potent an influence did this thing
have on those seamen in the 
ebuod who came to the full knowledge of
it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in
this matter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never

daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold than
commonb Ihey supposed a swordIfish had stabbed her, gentlemenb  ut the
captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck
awaited him in those latitudes  and therefore being very averse to buit
them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous, though,
indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low down
as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her
cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals 
but no good luck came  more days went by, and not only was the leak yet
undiscovered, but it sensibly increasedb oo much so, that now taking
some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest
harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and repairedb

 Ihough no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance
favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way,
because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at
them, those sisIandIthirty men of his could easily keep the ship free 
never mind if the leak should double on herb bn truth, well nigh the
whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breeces, the
IownI o had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port
without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for the
brutal overbearing of  adney, the mate, a iineyarder, and the bitterly
provoked vengeance of oteelkilt, a rakeman and desperado from  uffalob

gentlemen, in sbuareIsail brigs and threeImasted ships, wellInigh as
large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old sallao to far
 anilla  this rakeman, in the landIlocked heart of our rmerica, had yet
been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly
connected with the open oceanb ror in their interflowing aggregate,
those grand freshIwater seas of ours,IIsrie, and entario, and  uron, and
ouperior, and  ichigan,IIpossess an oceanIlike espansiveness, with many
of the ocean s noblest traits  with many of its rimmed varieties of
races and of climesb Ihey contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles,
even as the 
olynesian waters do  in large part, are shored by two great
contrasting nations, as the rtlantic is  they furnish long maritime
approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the sast, dotted
all round their banks  here and there are frowned upon by batteries,
and by the goatIlike craggy guns of lofty  ackinaw  they have heard the
fleet thunderings of naval victories  at intervals, they yield their
beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out
their peltry wigwams  for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient
and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines
of kings in  othic genealogies  those same woods harboring wild rfric
beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose esported furs give robes
to Iartar smperors  they mirror the paved capitals of  uffalo and
sleveland, as well as uinnebago villages  they float alike the
fullIrigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the otate, the steamer,
and the beech canoe  they are swept by  orean and dismasting blasts as
direful as any that lash the salted wave  they know what shipwrecks are,
for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many
a midnight ship with all its shrieking crewb Ihus, gentlemen, though
an inlander, oteelkilt was wildIocean born, and wildIocean nurtured 
as much of an audacious mariner as anyb rnd for  adney, though in his
infancy he may have laid him down on the lone santucket beach, to nurse
at his maternal sea  though in after life he had long followed our
austere rtlantic and your contemplative 
acific  yet was he buite as
vengeful and full of social buarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh
from the latitudes of buckIhorn handled bowieIknivesb eet was this
santucketer a man with some goodIhearted traits  and this rakeman, a
mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflesible
firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition
which is the meanest slave s right  thus treated, this oteelkilt had
long been retained harmless and docileb rt all events, he had proved
so thus far  but  adney was doomed and made mad, and oteelkiltIIbut,
gentlemen, you shall hearb

 bt was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing
her prow for her island haven, that the IownI o s leak seemed again
increasing, but only so as to rebuire an hour or more at the pumps
every dayb eou must know that in a settled and civiliced ocean like our
rtlantic, for esample, some skippers think little of pumping their whole
way across it  though of a still, sleepy night, should the officer of
the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the probability
would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on
account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottomb sor in the
solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward, gentlemen, is it
altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pumpIhandles in
full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length  that is, if it lie
along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other reasonable retreat
is afforded themb bt is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of
the way part of those waters, some really landless latitude, that her
captain begins to feel a little ansiousb

  uch this way had it been with the IownI o  so when her leak was found
gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by
several of her company  especially by  adney the mateb  e commanded
the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way
espanded to the breeceb sow this  adney, b suppose, was as little of a
coward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness
touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or
on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemenb Iherefore when
he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the
seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in
herb oo when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was on
this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood
with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water 
clear as any mountain spring, gentlemenIIthat bubbling from the pumps
ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee
scupperIholesb

 sow, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional
world of oursIIwatery or otherwise  that when a person placed in command
over his fellowImen finds one of them to be very significantly his
superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he
conceives an unconbuerable dislike and bitterness  and if he have a
chance he will pull down and pulverice that subaltern s tower, and
make a little heap of dust of itb  e this conceit of mine as it may,
gentlemen, at all events oteelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a
head like a  oman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings
of your last viceroy s snorting charger  and a brain, and a heart, and
a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made oteelkilt sharlemagne, had he
been born son to sharlemagne s fatherb  ut  adney, the mate, was ugly
as a mule  yet as hardy, as stubborn, as maliciousb  e did not love
oteelkilt, and oteelkilt knew itb

 sspying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the
rest, the rakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with
his gay banteringsb

  rye, aye, my merry lads, it s a lively leak this  hold a cannikin, one
of ye, and let s have a tasteb  y the rord, it s worth bottlings b tell
ye what, men, old  ad s investment must go for its he had best cut away
his part of the hull and tow it homeb Ihe fact is, boys, that swordIfish
only began the eob  he s come back again with a gang of shipIcarpenters,
sawIfish, and fileIfish, and what not  and the whole posse of  em
are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom  making
improvements, b supposeb bf old  ad were here now, b d tell him to eump
overboard and scatter  emb Ihey re playing the devil with his estate, b
can tell himb  ut he s a simple old soul,II ad, and a beauty toob  oys,
they say the rest of his property is invested in lookingIglassesb b
wonder if he d give a poor devil like me the model of his noseb 

  ramn your eyess what s that pump stopping forn  roared  adney,
pretending not to have heard the sailors  talkb  Ihunder away at its 

  rye, aye, sir,  said oteelkilt, merry as a cricketb  rively, boys,
lively, nows  rnd with that the pump clanged like fifty fireIengines 
the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping
of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life s
utmost energiesb

 euitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the rakeman went
forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass  his face
fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his
browb sow what cocening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed  adney
to meddle with such a man in that corporeally esasperated state, b know
not  but so it happenedb bntolerably striding along the deck, the mate
commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a
shovel, and remove some offensive matters consebuent upon allowing a pig
to run at largeb

 sow, gentlemen, sweeping a ship s deck at sea is a piece of household
work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every
evening  it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually
foundering at the timeb ouch, gentlemen, is the inflesibility of
seaIusages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen  some of whom
would not willingly drown without first washing their facesb  ut in all
vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys,
if boys there be aboardb  esides, it was the stronger men in the IownI o
that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps  and being
the most athletic seaman of them all, oteelkilt had been regularly
assigned captain of one of the gangs  consebuently he should have
been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical
duties, such being the case with his comradesb b mention all these
particulars so that you may understand esactly how this affair stood
between the two menb

  ut there was more than thisI the order about the shovel was almost as
plainly meant to sting and insult oteelkilt, as though  adney had spat
in his faceb rny man who has gone sailor in a whaleIship will
understand this  and all this and doubtless much more, the rakeman fully
comprehended when the mate uttered his commandb  ut as he sat still for
a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate s malignant eye and
perceived the stacks of powderIcasks heaped up in him and the slowImatch
silently burning along towards them  as he instinctively saw all
this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper
passionateness in any already ireful beingIIa repugnance most felt, when
felt at all, by really valiant men even when aggrievedIIthis nameless
phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over oteelkiltb

 Iherefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily
eshaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping
the deck was not his business, and he would not do itb rnd then, without
at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary
sweepers  who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done little or
nothing all dayb Io this,  adney replied with an oath, in a most
domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his
command  meanwhile advancing upon the still seated rakeman, with an
uplifted cooper s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near byb

  eated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for
all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating oteelkilt
could but ill brook this bearing in the mate  but somehow still
smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained
doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed  adney shook the
hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do
his biddingb

 oteelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily
followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his
intention not to obeyb oeeing, however, that his forbearance had not
the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his
twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man  but it was to
no purposeb rnd in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass 
when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had
now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the rakeman paused on
the hatches and thus spoke to the officerI

   rb  adney, b will not obey youb Iake that hammer away, or look to
yourselfb   ut the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where
the rakeman stood fised, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of
his teeth  meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictionsb
 etreating not the thousandth part of an inch  stabbing him in the eye
with the unflinching poniard of his glance, oteelkilt, clenching
his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his
persecutor that if the hammer but graced his cheek he ioteelkilti would
murder himb  ut, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter
by the godsb bmmediately the hammer touched the cheek  the nest instant
the lower eaw of the mate was stove in his head  he fell on the hatch
spouting blood like a whaleb

 sre the cry could go aft oteelkilt was shaking one of the backstays
leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their
mastheadsb Ihey were both sanallersb

  sanallerss  cried ron

breadth of the state of sew eork  through numerous populous cities and
most thriving villages  through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and
affluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility  by billiardIroom
and barIroom  through the holyIofIholies of great forests  on  oman
arches over bndian rivers  through sun and shade  by happy hearts or
broken  through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble  ohawk
counties  and especially, by rows of snowIwhite chapels, whose spires
stand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of ienetianly
corrupt and often lawless lifeb Ihere s your true rshantee, gentlemen 
there howl your pagans  where you ever find them, nest door to you 
under the longIflung shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churchesb
ror by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan
freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of eustice, so
sinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinitiesb

 rreely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the sanaller would make
a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesbuely wicked is heb rike

he indolently floats, openly toying with his redIcheeked sleopatra,
ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deckb  ut ashore, all this
effeminacy is dashedb Ihe brigandish guise which the sanaller so proudly
sports  his slouched and gailyIribboned hat betoken his grand featuresb

floats  his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in citiesb

these sanallers  b thank him heartily  would fain be not ungrateful 
but it is often one of the prime redeeming bualities of your man of
violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger
in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy oneb bn sum, gentlemen, what the
wildness of this canal life is, is emphatically evinced by this  that
our wild whaleIfishery contains so many of its most finished graduates,
and that scarce any race of mankind, escept oydney men, are so much
distrusted by our whaling captainsb sor does it at all diminish the
curiousness of this matter, that to many thousands of our rural boys and
young men born along its line, the probationary life of the  rand sanal
furnishes the sole transition between buietly reaping in a shristian
cornIfield, and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric
seasb

and holy as the hillsbII ut the storyb 

 b left off, gentlemen, where the rakeman shook the backstayb  ardly
had he done so, when he was surrounded by the three eunior mates and the
four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deckb  ut sliding down the
ropes like baleful comets, the two sanallers rushed into the uproar, and
sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastleb ethers of the
sailors eoined with them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued 
while standing out of harm s way, the valiant captain danced up and down
with a whaleIpike, calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious
scoundrel, and smoke him along to the buarterIdeckb rt intervals, he ran
close up to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying into
the heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the obeect of his
resentmentb  ut oteelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them
all  they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily
slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass,
these seaI
arisians entrenched themselves behind the barricadeb

  some out of that, ye piratess  roared the captain, now menacing them
with a pistol in each hand, eust brought to him by the stewardb  some
out of that, ye cutIthroatss 

 oteelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,
defied the worst the pistols could do  but gave the captain to
understand distinctly, that his ioteelkilt si death would be the signal
for a murderous mutiny on the part of all handsb rearing in his heart
lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but
still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their dutyb

  uill you promise not to touch us, if we don  demanded their
ringleaderb

  Iurn tos turn tosIIb make no promise IIto your dutys ro you want to

 Ihe rakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye
on the saptain, and eerking out such sentences as theseIII bt s not our

to turn to  treat us decently, and we re your men  but we won t be

  Iurn tos b make no promises, turn to, b says

discharge as soon as the anchor is down  so we don t want a row  it s

  Iurn tos  roared the saptainb

 oteelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then saidIII b tell you what
it is now, saptain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby
rascal, we won t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us  but till
you say the word about not flogging us, we don t do a hand s turnb 

  rown into the forecastle then, down with ye, b ll keep ye there till
ye re sick of itb rown ye gob 

  ohall wen  cried the ringleader to his menb  ost of them were against
it  but at length, in obedience to oteelkilt, they preceded him down
into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a caveb

 rs the rakeman s bare head was eust level with the planks, the saptain
and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide
of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called
for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the
companionwayb

 Ihen opening the slide a little, the saptain whispered something
down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon themIIten in
numberIIleaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had remained
neutralb

 rll night a wideIawake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and
aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway  at which
last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after breaking
through the bulkhead belowb  ut the hours of darkness passed in peace 
the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps,
whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night
dismally resounded through the shipb

 rt sunrise the saptain went forward, and knocking on the deck, summoned
the prisoners to work  but with a yell they refusedb uater was then
lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed
after it  when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it, the
saptain returned to the buarterIdeckb Iwice every day for three days
this was repeated  but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling, and
then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered  and
suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready
to turn tob Ihe fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet, united
perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to
surrender at discretionb smboldened by this, the saptain reiterated his
demand to the rest, but oteelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to
stop his babbling and betake himself where he belongedb en the fifth
morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the
desperate arms below that sought to restrain themb enly three were leftb

   etter turn to, nown  said the saptain with a heartless eeerb

  ohut us up again, will yes  cried oteelkiltb

  eh certainly,  said the saptain, and the key clickedb

 bt was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of seven
of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last
hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as
the bowels of despair  it was then that oteelkilt proposed to the two
sanallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst out of
their hole at the nest summoning of the garrison  and armed with their
keen mincing knives ilong, crescentic, heavy implements with a handle
at each endi run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail  and if by any
devilishness of desperation possible, seice the shipb ror himself, he
would do this, he said, whether they eoined him or notb Ihat was the
last night he should spend in that denb  ut the scheme met with no
opposition on the part of the other two  they swore they were ready for
that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrenderb
rnd what was more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck,
when the time to make the rush should comeb  ut to this their leader as
fiercely obeected, reserving that priority for himself  particularly as
his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter 
and both of them could not be first, for the ladder would but admit one
man at a timeb rnd here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants
must come outb

 bpon hearing the frantic proeect of their leader, each in his own
separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece
of treachery, namelyI to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be
the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender  and
thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might meritb
 ut when oteelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to
the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of villany, mised
their before secret treacheries together  and when their leader
fell into a doce, verbally opened their souls to each other in three
sentences  and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords 
and shrieked out for the saptain at midnightb

 Ihinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and
all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastleb bn a
few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still
struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious
allies, who at once claimed the honour of securing a man who had been
fully ripe for murderb  ut all these were collared, and dragged along
the deck like dead cattle  and, side by side, were seiced up into the
miccen rigging, like three buarters of meat, and there they hung till
morningb  ramn ye,  cried the saptain, pacing to and fro before them,
 the vultures would not touch ye, ye villainss 

 rt sunrise he summoned all hands  and separating those who had rebelled
from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the former that
he had a good mind to flog them all roundIIthought, upon the whole,
he would do soIIhe ought toIIeustice demanded it  but for the present,
considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with a
reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacularb

   ut as for you, ye carrion rogues,  turning to the three men in the
riggingII for you, b mean to mince ye up for the tryIpots   and,
seicing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the
two traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads
sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawnb

   y wrist is sprained with yes  he cried, at last   but there is still
rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn t give upb Iake
that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himselfb 

 ror a moment the eshausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his
cramped eaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a sort
of hiss,  uhat b say is thisIIand mind it wellIIif you flog me, b murder
yous 

  oay ye son then see how ye frighten me IIand the saptain drew off with
the rope to strikeb

   est not,  hissed the rakemanb

   ut b must, IIand the rope was once more drawn back for the strokeb

 oteelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the saptain 
who, to the amacement of all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly
two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope, said,  b
won t do itIIlet him goIIcut him downI d ye hearn 

  ut as the eunior mates were hurrying to esecute the order, a pale man,
with a bandaged head, arrested themII adney the chief mateb sver since
the blow, he had lain in his berth  but that morning, hearing the tumult
on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the whole
sceneb ouch was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly speak 
but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the
captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced to his
pinioned foeb

  eou are a cowards  hissed the rakemanb

  oo b am, but take thatb  Ihe mate was in the very act of striking,
when another hiss stayed his uplifted armb  e pausedI and then pausing
no more, made good his word, spite of oteelkilt s threat, whatever that
might have beenb Ihe three men were then cut down, all hands were turned
to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps clanged as
beforeb

 iust after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor
was heard in the forecastle  and the two trembling traitors running up,
besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crewb
sntreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own
instance they were put down in the ship s run for salvationb otill, no
sign of mutiny reappeared among the restb en the contrary, it seemed,
that mainly at oteelkilt s instigation, they had resolved to maintain
the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the
ship reached port, desert her in a bodyb  ut in order to insure the
speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thingIInamely,
not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discoveredb ror,
spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the IownI o still
maintained her mastIheads, and her captain was eust as willing to
lower for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the
cruising ground  and  adney the mate was buite as ready to change his
berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the
vital eaw of the whaleb

  ut though the rakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of
passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel iat least till all
was overi concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who
had stung him in the ventricles of his heartb  e was in  adney the chief
mate s watch  and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than
half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted,
against the espress counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head
of his watch at nightb bpon this, and one or two other circumstances,
oteelkilt systematically built the plan of his revengeb

 ruring the night,  adney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the
bulwarks of the buarterIdeck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of
the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship s sideb
bn this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes docedb Ihere was a
considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between
this was the seab oteelkilt calculated his time, and found that his nest
trick at the helm would come round at two o clock, in the morning of the
third day from that in which he had been betrayedb rt his leisure,
he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his
watches belowb

rakeman s monkey eacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for

deed he had plannedb eet complete revenge he had, and without being the
avengerb ror by a mysterious fatality,  eaven itself seemed to step in
to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have
doneb

 bt was eust between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second

drawing water in the mainIchains, all at once shouted out,  Ihere she

so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the

moment, the Ieneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted
his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been
plainly beheld from the three sullen mastIheadsb rll was now a phrensyb
 Ihe uhite uhaleIIthe uhite uhales  was the cry from captain, mates,
and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all ansious
to capture so famous and precious a fish  while the dogged crew eyed
askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass,
that lit up by a horicontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like
a living opal in the blue morning seab  entlemen, a strange fatality
pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out
before the world itself was chartedb Ihe mutineer was the bowsman of the
mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit nest him, while
 adney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or slacken
the line, at the word of commandb  oreover, when the four boats were
lowered, the mate s got the start  and none howled more fiercely with
delight than did oteelkilt, as he strained at his oarb rfter a stiff
pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand,  adney sprang to
the bowb  e was always a furious man, it seems, in a boatb rnd now his
bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale s topmost backb sothing
loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that
blent two whitenesses together  till of a sudden the boat struck as
against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing mateb
Ihat instant, as he fell on the whale s slippery back, the boat righted,
and was dashed aside by the swell, while  adney was tossed over into the
sea, on the other flank of the whaleb  e struck out through the spray,
and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly seeking to
remove himself from the eye of  oby rickb  ut the whale rushed round
in a sudden maelstrom  seiced the swimmer between his eaws  and rearing
high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went downb

  eantime, at the first tap of the boat s bottom, the rakeman had
slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool  calmly
looking on, he thought his own thoughtsb  ut a sudden, terrific,
downward eerking of the boat, buickly brought his knife to the lineb  e
cut it  and the whale was freeb  ut, at some distance,  oby rick rose
again, with some tatters of  adney s red woollen shirt, caught in the
teeth that had destroyed himb rll four boats gave chase again  but the
whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappearedb

 bn good time, the IownI o reached her portIIa savage, solitary
placeIIwhere no civiliced creature residedb Ihere, headed by the
rakeman, all but five or sis of the foremastmen deliberately deserted
among the palms  eventually, as it turned out, seicing a large double
warIcanoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harborb

 Ihe ship s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called
upon the bslanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving
down the ship to stop the leakb  ut to such unresting vigilance over
their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both
by night and by day, and so estreme was the hard work they underwent,
that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a
weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so
heavy a vesselb rfter taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the
ship as far off shore as possible  loaded and ran out his two cannon
from the bows  stacked his muskets on the poop  and warning the
bslanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with
him, and setting the sail of his best whaleIboat, steered straight
before the wind for Iahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a
reinforcement to his crewb

 en the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed
to have touched at a low isle of coralsb  e steered away from it  but
the savage craft bore down on him  and soon the voice of oteelkilt
hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under waterb Ihe captain
presented a pistolb uith one foot on each prow of the yoked warIcanoes,
the rakeman laughed him to scorn  assuring him that if the pistol so
much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and foamb

  uhat do you want of men  cried the captainb

  uhere are you boundn and for what are you boundn  demanded oteelkilt 
 no liesb 

  b am bound to Iahiti for more menb 

  iery goodb ret me board you a momentIIb come in peaceb  uith that he
leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat  and climbing the gunwale, stood
face to face with the captainb

  sross your arms, sir  throw back your headb sow, repeat after meb
rs soon as oteelkilt leaves me, b swear to beach this boat on yonder
island, and remain there sis daysb bf b do not, may lightning strike
mes 

  r pretty scholar,  laughed the rakemanb  rdios, oenors  and leaping
into the sea, he swam back to his comradesb

 uatching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the
roots of the cocoaInut trees, oteelkilt made sail again, and in due time
arrived at Iahiti, his own place of destinationb Ihere, luck befriended
him  two ships were about to sail for rrance, and were providentially
in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headedb Ihey
embarked  and so for ever got the start of their former captain, had he
been at all minded to work them legal retributionb

 oome ten days after the rrench ships sailed, the whaleIboat arrived,
and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civiliced
Iahitians, who had been somewhat used to the seab shartering a small
native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel  and finding all
right there, again resumed his cruisingsb

 uhere oteelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know  but upon the island of
santucket, the widow of  adney still turns to the sea which refuses
to give up its dead  still in dreams sees the awful white whale that
destroyed himb

s r
Is  ddb ef the  onstrous 
ictures of uhalesb


b shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,
something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the
eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored
alongside the whaleIship so that he can be fairly stepped upon thereb
bt may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those
curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day
confidently challenge the faith of the landsmanb bt is time to set the
world right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all
wrongb

bt may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will
be found among the oldest  indoo, sgyptian, and  recian sculpturesb ror
ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble
panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields,
medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of
chainIarmor like oaladin s, and a helmeted head like otb  eorge s  ever
since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not
only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific
presentations of himb

sow, by all odds, the most ancient estant portrait anyways purporting to
be the whale s, is to be found in the famous cavernIpagoda of slephanta,
in bndiab Ihe  rahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of
that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable
avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of them actually came
into beingb so wonder then, that in some sort our noble profession of
whaling should have been there shadowed forthb Ihe  indoo whale
referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall, depicting the
incarnation of iishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly known as the
 atse rvatarb  ut though this sculpture is half man and half whale, so
as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is
all wrongb bt looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the
broad palms of the true whale s maeestic flukesb

 ut go to the old  alleries, and look now at a great shristian painter s
portrait of this fish  for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian
 indoob bt is  uido s picture of 
erseus rescuing rndromeda from the
seaImonster or whaleb uhere did  uido get the model of such a strange
creature as thatn sor does  ogarth, in painting the same scene in his
own  
erseus rescending,  make out one whit betterb Ihe huge corpulence
of that  ogarthian monster undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing
one inch of waterb bt has a sort of howdah on its back, and its
distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling, might be
taken for the Iraitors   ate leading from the Ihames by water into the
Iowerb Ihen, there are the 
rodromus whales of old ocotch oibbald, and
ionah s whale, as depicted in the prints of old  ibles and the cuts of
old primersb uhat shall be said of thesen rs for the bookIbinder s whale
winding like a vineIstalk round the stock of a descending anchorIIas
stamped and gilded on the backs and titleIpages of many books both
old and newIIthat is a very picturesbue but purely fabulous creature,
imitated, b take it, from the like figures on antibue vasesb
Ihough universally denominated a dolphin, b nevertheless call this
bookIbinder s fish an attempt at a whale  because it was so intended
when the device was first introducedb bt was introduced by an old
btalian publisher somewhere about the  dth century, during the  evival
of rearning  and in those days, and even down to a comparatively
late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the
reviathanb

bn the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will
at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all manner
of spouts, eets d eau, hot springs and cold, oaratoga and  adenI aden,
come bubbling up from his uneshausted brainb bn the titleIpage of the
original edition of the  rdvancement of rearning  you will find some
curious whalesb

 ut buitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those
pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,
by those who knowb bn old  arris s collection of voyages there are some
plates of whales estracted from a rutch book of voyages, rbrb  id ,
entitled  r uhaling ioyage to opitcbergen in the ship ionas in the
uhale, 
eter 
eterson of rriesland, masterb  bn one of those plates the
whales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among iceIisles,
with white bears running over their living backsb bn another plate, the
prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular
flukesb

Ihen again, there is an imposing buarto, written by one saptain solnett,
a 
ost saptain in the snglish navy, entitled  r ioyage round sape  orn
into the oouth oeas, for the purpose of estending the opermaceti uhale
risheriesb  bn this book is an outline purporting to be a  
icture of
a 
hyseter or opermaceti whale, drawn by scale from one killed on the
coast of  esico, rugust,  d  , and hoisted on deckb  b doubt not the
captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marinesb
Io mention but one thing about it, let me say that it has an eye which
applied, according to the accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm
whale, would make the eye of that whale a bowIwindow some five feet
longb rh, my gallant captain, why did ye not give us ionah looking out
of that eyes

sor are the most conscientious compilations of satural  istory for
the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of
mistakeb rook at that popular work   oldsmith s rnimated satureb  bn the
abridged rondon edition of   nd, there are plates of an alleged  whale 
and a  narwhaleb  b do not wish to seem inelegant, but this unsightly
whale looks much like an amputated sow  and, as for the narwhale, one
glimpse at it is enough to amace one, that in this nineteenth century
such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent
public of schoolboysb

Ihen, again, in   dd,  ernard  ermain, sount de racepede, a great
naturalist, published a scientific systemiced whale book, wherein are
several pictures of the different species of the reviathanb rll these
are not only incorrect, but the picture of the  ysticetus or  reenland
whale ithat is to say, the  ight whalei, even ocoresby, a long
esperienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its
counterpart in natureb

 ut the placing of the capIsheaf to all this blundering business was
reserved for the scientific rrederick suvier, brother to the famous
 aronb bn    i, he published a satural  istory of uhales, in which he
gives what he calls a picture of the operm uhaleb  efore showing that
picture to any santucketer, you had best provide for your summary
retreat from santucketb bn a word, rrederick suvier s operm uhale is not
a operm uhale, but a sbuashb ef course, he never had the benefit of
a whaling voyage isuch men seldom havei, but whence he derived that
picture, who can telln 
erhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor
in the same field, resmarest, got one of his authentic abortions  that
is, from a shinese drawingb rnd what sort of lively lads with the pencil
those shinese are, many bueer cups and saucers inform usb

rs for the signIpainters  whales seen in the streets hanging over the
shops of oilIdealers, what shall be said of themn Ihey are generally
 ichard bbbb whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage  breakfasting
on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of marinersI
their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paintb

 ut these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very
surprising after allb sonsiders  ost of the scientific drawings have
been taken from the stranded fish  and these are about as correct as a
drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent
the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and sparsb
Ihough elephants have stood for their fullIlengths, the living reviathan
has never yet fairly floated himself for his portraitb Ihe living whale,
in his full maeesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in
unfathomable waters  and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight,
like a launched lineIofIbattle ship  and out of that element it is a
thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the
air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulationsb rnd, not
to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young
sucking whale and a fullIgrown 
latonian reviathan  yet, even in the
case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship s deck, such
is then the outlandish, eelIlike, limbered, varying shape of him, that
his precise espression the devil himself could not catchb

 ut it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded
whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true formb sot at allb
ror it is one of the more curious things about this reviathan, that
his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shapeb Ihough ieremy
 entham s skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of
his esecutors, correctly conveys the idea of a burlyIbrowed utilitarian
old gentleman, with all ieremy s other leading personal characteristics 
yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan s
articulated bonesb bn fact, as the great  unter says, the mere skeleton
of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded
animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes
itb Ihis peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some
part of this book will be incidentally shownb bt is also very curiously
displayed in the side fin, the bones of which almost esactly answer to
the bones of the human hand, minus only the thumbb Ihis fin has four
regular boneIfingers, the indes, middle, ring, and little fingerb  ut
all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human
fingers in an artificial coveringb   owever recklessly the whale may
sometimes serve us,  said humorous otubb one day,  he can never be truly
said to handle us without mittensb 

ror all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs
conclude that the great reviathan is that one creature in the world
which must remain unpainted to the lastb Irue, one portrait may hit
the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very
considerable degree of esactnessb oo there is no earthly way of finding
out precisely what the whale really looks likeb rnd the only mode in
which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is
by going a whaling yourself  but by so doing, you run no small risk of
being eternally stove and sunk by himb uherefore, it seems to me you had
best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this reviathanb

Is  dib ef the ress srroneous 
ictures of uhales, and the Irue

ictures of uhaling ocenesb


bn connesion with the monstrous pictures of whales, b am strongly
tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of
them which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,
especially in 
liny, 
urchas,  ackluyt,  arris, suvier, etcb  ut b pass
that matter byb

b know of only four published outlines of the great operm uhale 
solnett s,  uggins s, rrederick suvier s, and  eale sb bn the previous
chapter solnett and suvier have been referred tob  uggins s is far
better than theirs  but, by great odds,  eale s is the bestb rll  eale s
drawings of this whale are good, escepting the middle figure in the
picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second
chapterb  is frontispiece, boats attacking operm uhales, though no
doubt calculated to escite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is
admirably correct and lifeIlike in its general effectb oome of the operm
uhale drawings in ib  oss  rowne are pretty correct in contour  but they
are wretchedly engravedb Ihat is not his fault thoughb

ef the  ight uhale, the best outline pictures are in ocoresby  but they
are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impressionb  e has
but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency, because
it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you can derive
anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living
huntersb

 ut, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details
not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to
be anywhere found, are two large rrench engravings, well esecuted,
and taken from paintings by one  arneryb  espectively, they represent
attacks on the operm and  ight uhaleb bn the first engraving a noble
operm uhale is depicted in full maeesty of might, eust risen beneath
the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the air
upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planksb Ihe prow of
the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn eust balancing upon
the monster s spine  and standing in that prow, for that one single
incomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the
incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if
from a precipiceb Ihe action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and
trueb Ihe halfIemptied lineItub floats on the whitened sea  the wooden
poles of the spilled harpoons oblibuely bob in it  the heads of the
swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting espressions
of affright  while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down
upon the sceneb oerious fault might be found with the anatomical details
of this whale, but let that pass  since, for the life of me, b could not
draw so good a oneb

bn the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside
the barnacled flank of a large running  ight uhale, that rolls his black
weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rockIslide from the 
atagonian
cliffsb  is eets are erect, full, and black like soot  so that from so
abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there must be a brave
supper cooking in the great bowels belowb oea fowls are pecking at the
small crabs, shellIfish, and other sea candies and maccaroni, which the
 ight uhale sometimes carries on his pestilent backb rnd all the while
the thickIlipped leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of
tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock
in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddleIwheels of an ocean
steamerb Ihus, the foreground is all raging commotion  but behind, in
admirable artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the
drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of
a dead whale, a conbuered fortress, with the flag of capture lacily
hanging from the whaleIpole inserted into his spoutIholeb

uho  arnery the painter is, or was, b know notb  ut my life for it he
was either practically conversant with his subeect, or else marvellously
tutored by some esperienced whalemanb Ihe rrench are the lads for
painting actionb  o and gace upon all the paintings of surope, and
where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion
on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at iersailles  where the beholder
fights his way, pellImell, through the consecutive great battles of
rrance  where every sword seems a flash of the sorthern rights, and the
successive armed kings and smperors dash by, like a charge of crowned
centaursn sot wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery, are these sea
battleIpieces of  arneryb

Ihe natural aptitude of the rrench for seicing the picturesbueness of
things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings
they have of their whaling scenesb uith not one tenth of sngland s
esperience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the
rmericans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only
finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of
the whale huntb ror the most part, the snglish and rmerican whale
draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline
of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale  which, so far as
picturesbueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to sketching
the profile of a pyramidb sven ocoresby, the eustly renowned  ight
whaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the  reenland whale,
and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats
us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives,
and grapnels  and with the microscopic diligence of a reuwenhoeck
submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninetyIsis facIsimiles of
magnified rrctic snow crystalsb b mean no disparagement to the escellent
voyager ib honour him for a veterani, but in so important a matter it
was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a
sworn affidavit taken before a  reenland iustice of the 
eaceb

bn addition to those fine engravings from  arnery, there are two other
rrench engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself
  b rurandb  ene of them, though not precisely adapted to our present
purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accountsb bt is a buiet
noonIscene among the isles of the 
acific  a rrench whaler anchored,
inshore, in a calm, and lacily taking water on board  the loosened sails
of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background, both
drooping together in the breeceless airb Ihe effect is very fine, when
considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under
one of their few aspects of oriental reposeb Ihe other engraving is
buite a different affairI the ship hoveIto upon the open sea, and in the
very heart of the reviathanic life, with a  ight uhale alongside  the
vessel iin the act of cuttingIini hove over to the monster as if to a
buay  and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is
about giving chase to whales in the distanceb Ihe harpoons and lances
lie levelled for use  three oarsmen are eust setting the mast in its
hole  while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands
halfIerect out of the water, like a rearing horseb rrom the ship, the
smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke
over a village of smithies  and to windward, a black cloud, rising up
with earnest of sbualls and rains, seems to buicken the activity of the
escited seamenb

Is  d b  ritb


oteering northIeastward from the srocetts, we fell in with vast meadows
of brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the  ight uhale
largely feedsb ror leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that we
seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheatb

en the second day, numbers of  ight uhales were seen, who, secure from
the attack of a operm uhaler like the 
ebuod, with open eaws sluggishly
swam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that
wondrous ienetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated
from the water that escaped at the lipb

rs morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance
their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads  even so these
monsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound  and leaving
behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow seabi


iIhat part of the sea known among whalemen as the   racil  anks  does
not bear that name as the  anks of sewfoundland do, because of there
being shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable
meadowIlike appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually
floating in those latitudes, where the  ight uhale is often chasedb


 ut it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all
reminded one of mowersb oeen from the mastIheads, especially when they
paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms looked
more like lifeless masses of rock than anything elseb rnd as in the
great hunting countries of bndia, the stranger at a distance will
sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them
to be such, taking them for bare, blackened elevations of the soil  even
so, often, with him, who for the first time beholds this species of the
leviathans of the seab rnd even when recognised at last, their immense
magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses
of overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort
of life that lives in a dog or a horseb

bndeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the
deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shoreb ror though
some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are
of their kind in the sea  and though taking a broad general view of
the thing, this may very well be  yet coming to specialties, where, for
esample, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to
the sagacious kindness of the dogn Ihe accursed shark alone can in any
generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to himb

 ut though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the
seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and
repelling  though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita,
so that solumbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his
one superficial western one  though, by vast odds, the most terrific
of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen
tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters 
though but a moment s consideration will teach, that however baby man
may brag of his science and skill, and however much, in a flattering
future, that science and skill may augment  yet for ever and for ever,
to the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverice
the stateliest, stiffest frigate he can make  nevertheless, by the
continual repetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense
of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to itb

Ihe first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with 
ortuguese
vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widowb
Ihat same ocean rolls now  that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships
of last yearb eea, foolish mortals, soah s flood is not yet subsided 
two thirds of the fair world it yet coversb

uherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a
miracle upon the othern 
reternatural terrors rested upon the  ebrews,
when under the feet of norah and his company the live ground opened
and swallowed them up for ever  yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in
precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crewsb

 ut not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it
is also a fiend to its own offIspring  worse than the 
ersian host who
murdered his own guests  sparing not the creatures which itself hath
spawnedb rike a savage tigress that tossing in the eungle overlays her
own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks,
and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of shipsb so
mercy, no power but its own controls itb 
anting and snorting like a mad
battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean overruns the
globeb

sonsider the subtleness of the sea  how its most dreaded creatures glide
under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden
beneath the loveliest tints of acureb sonsider also the devilish
brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the
dainty embellished shape of many species of sharksb sonsider, once more,
the universal cannibalism of the sea  all whose creatures prey upon each
other, carrying on eternal war since the world beganb

sonsider all this  and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile
earth  consider them both, the sea and the land  and do you not find a
strange analogy to something in yourselfn ror as this appalling ocean
surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular
Iahiti, full of peace and eoy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the
half known lifeb  od keep thees

Is  d b obuidb


olowly wading through the meadows of brit, the 
ebuod still held on her
way northIeastward towards the island of iava  a gentle air impelling
her keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering
masts mildly waved to that languid breece, as three mild palms on a
plainb rnd still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely,
alluring eet would be seenb

 ut one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural
spread over the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm  when
the long burnished sunIglade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid
across them, eneoining some secrecy  when the slippered waves whispered
together as they softly ran on  in this profound hush of the visible
sphere a strange spectre was seen by raggoo from the mainImastIheadb

bn the distance, a great white mass lacily rose, and rising higher and
higher, and disentangling itself from the acure, at last gleamed before
our prow like a snowIslide, new slid from the hillsb Ihus glistening
for a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sankb Ihen once more arose,
and silently gleamedb bt seemed not a whale  and yet is this  oby rickn
thought raggoob rgain the phantom went down, but on reIappearing once
more, with a stilettoIlike cry that startled every man from his nod, the
negro yelled outII Iheres there agains there she breachess right aheads
Ihe uhite uhale, the uhite uhales 

bpon this, the seamen rushed to the yardIarms, as in swarmingItime the
bees rush to the boughsb  areIheaded in the sultry sun, rhab stood on
the bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave
his orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction
indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of raggoob

uhether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary eet had
gradually worked upon rhab, so that he was now prepared to connect the
ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular
whale he pursued  however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed
him  whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly
perceive the white mass, than with a buick intensity he instantly gave
orders for loweringb

Ihe four boats were soon on the water  rhab s in advance, and all
swiftly pulling towards their preyb ooon it went down, and while, with
oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, los in the same
spot where it sank, once more it slowly roseb rlmost forgetting for
the moment all thoughts of  oby rick, we now gaced at the most wondrous
phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankindb
r vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing
creamIcolour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms radiating
from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas, as
if blindly to clutch at any hapless obeect within reachb so perceptible
face or front did it have  no conceivable token of either sensation or
instinct  but undulated there on the billows, an unearthly, formless,
chanceIlike apparition of lifeb

rs with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, otarbuck still
gacing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice
esclaimedII rlmost rather had b seen  oby rick and fought him, than to
have seen thee, thou white ghosts 

 uhat was it, oirn  said rlaskb

 Ihe great live sbuid, which, they say, few whaleIships ever beheld, and
returned to their ports to tell of itb 

 ut rhab said nothing  turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel 
the rest as silently followingb

uhatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with
the sight of this obeect, certain it is, that a glimpse of it being
so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with
portentousnessb oo rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them
declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few
of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and
form  notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale
his only foodb ror though other species of whales find their food above
water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the spermaceti
whale obtains his whole food in unknown cones below the surface  and
only by inference is it that any one can tell of what, precisely, that
food consistsb rt times, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what
are supposed to be the detached arms of the sbuid  some of them thus
eshibited esceeding twenty and thirty feet in lengthb Ihey fancy that
the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to
the bed of the ocean  and that the sperm whale, unlike other species, is
supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear itb

Ihere seems some ground to imagine that the great nraken of  ishop

ontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into obuidb Ihe manner in
which the  ishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with
some other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspondb
 ut much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he
assigns itb

 y some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious
creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of cuttleIfish,
to which, indeed, in certain esternal respects it would seem to belong,
but only as the rnak of the tribeb



s r
Is  inb Ihe rineb


uith reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as
for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented,
b have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whaleIlineb

Ihe line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly
vapoured with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary
ropes  for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to
the ropeImaker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the
sailor for common ship use  yet, not only would the ordinary buantity
too much stiffen the whaleIline for the close coiling to which it must
be subeected  but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general
by no means adds to the rope s durability or strength, however much it
may give it compactness and glossb

ef late years the  anilla rope has in the rmerican fishery almost
entirely superseded hemp as a material for whaleIlines  for, though not
so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic  and
b will add isince there is an aesthetics in all thingsi, is much more
handsome and becoming to the boat, than hempb  emp is a dusky, dark
fellow, a sort of bndian  but  anilla is as a goldenIhaired sircassian
to beholdb

Ihe whaleIline is only twoIthirds of an inch in thicknessb rt first
sight, you would not think it so strong as it really isb  y esperiment
its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and
twenty pounds  so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly ebual
to three tonsb bn length, the common sperm whaleIline measures something
over two hundred fathomsb Iowards the stern of the boat it is spirally
coiled away in the tub, not like the wormIpipe of a still though, but so
as to form one round, cheeseIshaped mass of densely bedded  sheaves,  or
layers of concentric spiralications, without any hollow but the  heart, 
or minute vertical tube formed at the asis of the cheeseb rs the least
tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take
somebody s arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used
in stowing the line in its tubb oome harpooneers will consume almost an
entire morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and then
reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the act
of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twistsb

bn the snglish boats two tubs are used instead of one  the same line
being continuously coiled in both tubsb Ihere is some advantage in this 
because these twinItubs being so small they fit more readily into the
boat, and do not strain it so much  whereas, the rmerican tub, nearly
three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky
freight for a craft whose planks are but one halfIinch in thickness  for
the bottom of the whaleIboat is like critical ice, which will bear up
a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated
oneb uhen the painted canvas cover is clapped on the rmerican lineItub,
the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great
weddingIcake to present to the whalesb

 oth ends of the line are esposed  the lower end terminating in an
eyeIsplice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the
tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everythingb
Ihis arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accountsb rirstI
bn order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a
neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as
to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the
harpoonb bn these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug
of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other  though the
first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consortb oecondI Ihis
arrangement is indispensable for common safety s sake  for were the
lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the
whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking
minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed
boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of
the sea  and in that case no townIcrier would ever find her againb

 efore lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is
taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again
carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon
the loom or handle of every man s oar, so that it eogs against his wrist
in rowing  and also passing between the men, as they alternately sit at
the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the estreme
pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the sice of a
common buill, prevents it from slipping outb rrom the chocks it hangs
in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat
again  and some ten or twenty fathoms icalled bosIlinei being coiled
upon the bos in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a
little further aft, and is then attached to the shortIwarpIIthe rope
which is immediately connected with the harpoon  but previous to that
connesion, the shortIwarp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious
to detailb

Ihus the whaleIline folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,
twisting and writhing around it in almost every directionb rll the
oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions  so that to the timid
eye of the landsman, they seem as bndian eugglers, with the deadliest
snakes sportively festooning their limbsb sor can any son of mortal
woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies,
and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any
unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible
contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings  he cannot be thus
circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones
to buiver in him like a shaken eellyb eet habitIIstrange things what
cannot habit accomplishnII ayer sallies, more merry mirth, better eokes,
and brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you
will hear over the halfIinch white cedar of the whaleIboat, when thus
hung in hangman s nooses  and, like the sis burghers of salais before
ning sdward, the sis men composing the crew pull into the eaws of death,
with a halter around every neck, as you may sayb


erhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for
those repeated whaling disastersIIsome few of which are casually
chronicledIIof this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the
line, and lostb ror, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in
the boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whiccings
of a steamIengine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and
wheel, is gracing youb bt is worse  for you cannot sit motionless in the
heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and
you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest warning 
and only by a certain selfIadeusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of
volition and action, can you escape being made a  aceppa of, and run
away with where the allIseeing sun himself could never pierce you outb

rgainI as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and
prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself 
for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm  and
contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal
powder, and the ball, and the esplosion  so the graceful repose of the
line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought
into actual playIIthis is a thing which carries more of true terror than
any other aspect of this dangerous affairb  ut why say moren rll men
live enveloped in whaleIlinesb rll are born with halters round their
necks  but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death,
that mortals realice the silent, subtle, everIpresent perils of lifeb
rnd if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whaleIboat, you would
not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before
your evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your sideb

bf to otarbuck the apparition of the obuid was a thing of portents, to
eueebueg it was buite a different obeectb

 uhen you see him  buid,  said the savage, honing his harpoon in the bow
of his hoisted boat,  then you buick see him  parm whaleb 

Ihe nest day was esceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special
to engage them, the 
ebuod s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep
induced by such a vacant seab ror this part of the bndian ecean through
which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground

and other vivacious denicens of more stirring waters, than those off the

bt was my turn to stand at the foremastIhead  and with my shoulders
leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro b idly swayed in
what seemed an enchanted airb so resolution could withstand it  in that
dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of my
body  though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will, long
after the power which first moved it is withdrawnb

sre forgetfulness altogether came over me, b had noticed that the seamen
at the main and miccenImastIheads were already drowsyb oo that at last
all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every swing
that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsmanb
Ihe waves, too, nodded their indolent crests  and across the wide trance
of the sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over allb

ouddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes  like vices my
hands grasped the shrouds  some invisible, gracious agency preserved me 
with a shock b came back to lifeb rnd los close under our lee, not forty
fathoms off, a gigantic operm uhale lay rolling in the water like the
capsiced hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an sthiopian hue,
glistening in the sun s rays like a mirrorb  ut lacily undulating in
the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranbuilly spouting his vapoury
eet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm
afternoonb  ut that pipe, poor whale, was thy lastb rs if struck by some
enchanter s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once
started into wakefulness  and more than a score of voices from all parts
of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted
forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted
the sparkling brine into the airb

 slear away the boatss ruffs  cried rhabb rnd obeying his own order, he
dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokesb

Ihe sudden esclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale  and ere
the boats were down, maeestically turning, he swam away to the leeward,
but with such a steady tranbuillity, and making so few ripples as he
swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed, rhab gave
orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak but in
whispersb oo seated like entario bndians on the gunwales of the boats,
we swiftly but silently paddled along  the calm not admitting of the
noiseless sails being setb 
resently, as we thus glided in chase, the
monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air, and
then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed upb

 Ihere go flukess  was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by
otubb s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite was
grantedb rfter the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the whale
rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker s boat, and much
nearer to it than to any of the others, otubb counted upon the honour
of the captureb bt was obvious, now, that the whale had at length become
aware of his pursuersb rll silence of cautiousness was therefore no
longer of useb 
addles were dropped, and oars came loudly into playb rnd
still puffing at his pipe, otubb cheered on his crew to the assaultb

ees, a mighty change had come over the fishb rll alive to his eeopardy,
he was going  head out   that part oblibuely proeecting from the mad
yeast which he brewedbi


ibt will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance
the entire interior of the sperm whale s enormous head consistsb Ihough
apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about
himb oo that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does
so when going at his utmost speedb  esides, such is the breadth of the
upper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cutIwater
formation of the lower part, that by oblibuely elevating his head, he
thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluffIbowed sluggish
galliot into a sharppointed sew eork pilotIboatb

turns were taken, so that the line began holding its placeb Ihe boat now
flew through the boiling water like a shark all finsb otubb and Iashtego
here changed placesIIstem for sternIIa staggering business truly in that
rocking commotionb


i
artly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be
stated, that, in the old rutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the
running line with water  in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or
bailer, is set apart for that purposeb eour hat, however, is the most
convenientb


rrom the vibrating line estending the entire length of the upper part of
the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you would
have thought the craft had two keelsIIone cleaving the water, the other
the airIIas the boat churned on through both opposing elements at onceb
r continual cascade played at the bows  a ceaseless whirling eddy in
her wake  and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a little
finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale
into the seab Ihus they rushed  each man with might and main clinging
to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam  and the tall form of
Iashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order to bring
down his centre of gravityb uhole rtlantics and 
acifics seemed passed
as they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened
his flightb

  aul inIIhaul ins  cried otubb to the bowsmans and, facing round
towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while yet
the boat was being towed onb ooon ranging up by his flank, otubb, firmly
planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the
flying fish  at the word of command, the boat alternately sterning
out of the way of the whale s horrible wallow, and then ranging up for
another flingb

Ihe red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a
hillb  is tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which bubbled
and seethed for furlongs behind in their wakeb Ihe slanting sun playing
upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every
face, so that they all glowed to each other like red menb rnd all
the while, eet after eet of white smoke was agonicingly shot from the
spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of
the escited headsman  as at every dart, hauling in upon his crooked
lance iby the line attached to iti, otubb straightened it again and
again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and again
sent it into the whaleb

 
ull upIIpull ups  he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale
relased in his wrathb  
ull upsIIclose tos  and the boat ranged along
the fish s flankb uhen reaching far over the bow, otubb slowly churned
his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully
churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold
watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of
breaking ere he could hook it outb  ut that gold watch he sought was the
innermost life of the fishb rnd now it is struck  for, starting from
his trance into that unspeakable thing called his  flurry,  the monster
horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped himself in impenetrable,
mad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled craft, instantly dropping
astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied
twilight into the clear air of the dayb

rnd now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into view 
surging from side to side  spasmodically dilating and contracting his
spoutIhole, with sharp, cracking, agoniced respirationsb rt last, gush
after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees of red
wine, shot into the frighted air  and falling back again, ran dripping
down his motionless flanks into the seab  is heart had bursts

  e s dead,  rb otubb,  said raggoob

 ees  both pipes smoked outs  and withdrawing his own from his mouth,
otubb scattered the dead ashes over the water  and, for a moment, stood
thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had madeb



s r
Is  idb Ihe rartb


r word concerning an incident in the last chapterb

rccording to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whaleIboat pushes
off from the ship, with the headsman or whaleIkiller as temporary
steersman, and the harpooneer or whaleIfastener pulling the foremost
oar, the one known as the harpooneerIoarb sow it needs a strong, nervous
arm to strike the first iron into the fish  for often, in what is called
a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of
twenty or thirty feetb  ut however prolonged and eshausting the chase,
the harpooneer is espected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost 
indeed, he is espected to set an esample of superhuman activity to the
rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid
esclamations  and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one s
compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half startedIIwhat
that is none know but those who have tried itb ror one, b cannot bawl
very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same timeb bn this
straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the fish, all at once
the eshausted harpooneer hears the esciting cryII otand up, and give it
to hims   e now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round on his
centre half way, seice his harpoon from the crotch, and with what little
strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the whaleb so
wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out of fifty
fair chances for a dart, not five are successful  no wonder that so many
hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated  no wonder that some
of them actually burst their bloodIvessels in the boat  no wonder that
some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels  no wonder
that to many ship owners, whaling is but a losing concern  for it is the
harpooneer that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his
body how can you espect to find it there when most wanteds

rgain, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,
that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer
likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent eeopardy of
themselves and every one elseb bt is then they change places  and
the headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper
station in the bows of the boatb

sow, b care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both foolish
and unnecessaryb Ihe headsman should stay in the bows from first to
last  he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no rowing
whatever should be espected of him, escept under circumstances obvious
to any fishermanb b know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss
of speed in the chase  but long esperience in various whalemen of more
than one nation has convinced me that in the vast maeority of failures
in the fishery, it has not by any means been so much the speed of the
whale as the before described eshaustion of the harpooneer that has
caused themb

Io insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this
world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out of
toilb



s r
Is  i b Ihe srotchb


eut of the trunk, the branches grow  out of them, the twigsb oo, in
productive subeects, grow the chaptersb

Ihe crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mentionb
bt is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which
is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow,
for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden estremity of the
harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly proeects from the prowb
Ihereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it
up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from
the wallb bt is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch,
respectively called the first and second ironsb

 ut these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with
the line  the obeect being thisI to dart them both, if possible, one
instantly after the other into the same whale  so that if, in the coming
drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a holdb bt is a
doubling of the chancesb  ut it very often happens that owing to the
instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon receiving
the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however
lightningIlike in his movements, to pitch the second iron into himb
severtheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line,
and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events, be
anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere  else the
most terrible eeopardy would involve all handsb Iumbled into the water,
it accordingly is in such cases  the spare coils of bos line imentioned
in a preceding chapteri making this feat, in most instances, prudently
practicableb  ut this critical act is not always unattended with the
saddest and most fatal casualtiesb

rurthermoreI you must know that when the second iron is thrown
overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharpIedged terror,
skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines,
or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directionsb
sor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is
fairly captured and a corpseb

sonsider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging
one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale  when owing to these
bualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of
such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be
simultaneously dangling about himb ror, of course, each boat is supplied
with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one
be ineffectually darted without recoveryb rll these particulars are
faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate several
most important, however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be
paintedb



s r
Is  i b otubb s oupperb


otubb s whale had been killed some distance from the shipb bt was
a calm  so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow
business of towing the trophy to the 
ebuodb rnd now, as we eighteen men
with our thirtyIsis arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers,
slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse in the
sea  and it seemed hardly to budge at all, escept at long intervals 
good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we
movedb ror, upon the great canal of  angI o, or whatever they call
it, in shina, four or five laborers on the footIpath will draw a bulky
freighted eunk at the rate of a mile an hour  but this grand argosy we
towed heavily forged along, as if laden with pigIlead in bulkb

rarkness came on  but three lights up and down in the 
ebuod s
mainIrigging dimly guided our way  till drawing nearer we saw rhab
dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarksb iacantly eyeing
the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for securing
it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way
into the cabin, and did not come forward again until morningb

Ihough, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, saptain rhab had
evinced his customary activity, to call it so  yet now that the creature
was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair, seemed
working in him  as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that
 oby rick was yet to be slain  and though a thousand other whales were
brought to his ship, all that would not one eot advance his grand,
monomaniac obeectb iery soon you would have thought from the sound on
the 
ebuod s decks, that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in
the deep  for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck, and thrust
rattling out of the portIholesb  ut by those clanking links, the vast
corpse itself, not the ship, is to be mooredb Iied by the head to the
stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies with its black
hull close to the vessel s and seen through the darkness of the night,
which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the twoIIship and whale,
seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while
the other remains standingbi


ir little item may as well be related hereb Ihe strongest and most
reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,
is by the flukes or tail  and as from its greater density that part
is relatively heavier than any other iescepting the sideIfinsi, its
flesibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface  so
that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to
put the chain round itb  ut this difficulty is ingeniously overcomeI a
small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end, and
a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the shipb  y
adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side
of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily
made to follow suit  and being slipped along the body, is at last locked
fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of eunction with
its broad flukes or lobesb


bf moody rhab was now all buiescence, at least so far as could be known
on deck, otubb, his second mate, flushed with conbuest, betrayed an
unusual but still goodInatured escitementb ouch an unwonted bustle was
he in that the staid otarbuck, his official superior, buietly resigned
to him for the time the sole management of affairsb ene small, helping
cause of all this liveliness in otubb, was soon made strangely manifestb
otubb was a high liver  he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale
as a flavorish thing to his palateb

 r steak, a steak, ere b sleeps eou, raggoos overboard you go, and cut
me one from his smalls 

 ere be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general
thing, and according to the great military masim, make the enemy defray
the current espenses of the war iat least before realicing the proceeds
of the voyagei, yet now and then you find some of these santucketers
who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the operm uhale
designated by otubb  comprising the tapering estremity of the bodyb

rbout midnight that steak was cut and cooked  and lighted by two
lanterns of sperm oil, otubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper
at the capstanIhead, as if that capstan were a sideboardb sor was otubb
the only banbueter on whale s flesh that nightb  ingling their mumblings
with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks, swarming
round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatnessb Ihe few
sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping
of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the sleepers 
heartsb 
eering over the side you could eust see them ias before you
heard themi wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and turning over on
their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the
bigness of a human headb Ihis particular feat of the shark seems all
but miraculousb  ow at such an apparently unassailable surface, they
contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the
universal problem of all thingsb Ihe mark they thus leave on the whale,
may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking
for a screwb

Ihough amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a seaIfight, sharks
will be seen longingly gacing up to the ship s decks, like hungry dogs
round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down
every killed man that is tossed to them  and though, while the valiant
butchers over the deckItable are thus cannibally carving each other s
live meat with carvingIknives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks,
also, with their eewelIhilted mouths, are buarrelsomely carving away
under the table at the dead meat  and though, were you to turn the whole
affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing, that
is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties  and
though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships
crossing the rtlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in
case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently
buried  and though one or two other like instances might be set down,
touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do most
socially congregate, and most hilariously feast  yet is there no
conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless
numbers, and in gayer or more eovial spirits, than around a dead sperm
whale, moored by night to a whaleship at seab bf you have never
seen that sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of
devilIworship, and the espediency of conciliating the devilb

 ut, as yet, otubb heeded not the mumblings of the banbuet that was
going on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his
own epicurean lipsb

 sook, cooksIIwhere s that old rleecen  he cried at length, widening
his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper 
and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing
with his lance   cook, you cooksIIsail this way, cooks 

Ihe old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously
roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came shambling
along from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was something
the matter with his kneeIpans, which he did not keep well scoured like
his other pans  this old rleece, as they called him, came shuffling and
limping along, assisting his step with his tongs, which, after a clumsy
fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops  this old sbony floundered
along, and in obedience to the word of command, came to a dead stop on
the opposite side of otubb s sideboard  when, with both hands folded
before him, and resting on his twoIlegged cane, he bowed his arched back
still further over, at the same time sideways inclining his head, so as
to bring his best ear into playb

 sook,  said otubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his
mouth,  don t you think this steak is rather overdonen eou ve been
beating this steak too much, cook  it s too tenderb ron t b always say
that to be good, a whaleIsteak must be toughn Ihere are those sharks

keep buietb  last me, if b can hear my own voiceb rway, cook, and
deliver my messageb  ere, take this lantern,  snatching one from his
sideboard   now then, go and preach to  ems 

oullenly taking the offered lantern, old rleece limped across the deck
to the bulwarks  and then, with one hand dropping his light low over the
sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other hand
he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side in a
mumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while otubb, softly crawling
behind, overheard all that was saidb

 rellowIcrittersI b se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam

s r
Is  idb Ihe uhale as a rishb


Ihat mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,
like otubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say  this seems so
outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and
philosophy of itb

bt is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the  ight
uhale was esteemed a great delicacy in rrance, and commanded large
prices thereb rlso, that in  enry ibbbth s time, a certain cook of the
court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be
eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of
whaleb 
orpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eatingb Ihe
meat is made into balls about the sice of billiard balls, and being well
seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtleIballs or veal ballsb
Ihe old monks of runfermline were very fond of themb Ihey had a great
porpoise grant from the crownb

Ihe fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all
hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him  but
when you come to sit down before a meatIpie nearly one hundred feet
long, it takes away your appetiteb enly the most unpreeudiced of men
like otubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales  but the ssbuimaus are not
so fastidiousb ue all know how they live upon whales, and have rare
old vintages of prime old train oilb iogranda, one of their most famous
doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being esceedingly
euicy and nourishingb rnd this reminds me that certain snglishmen, who
long ago were accidentally left in  reenland by a whaling vesselIIthat
these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of
whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubberb rmong
the rutch whalemen these scraps are called  fritters   which, indeed,
they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something
like old rmsterdam housewives  doughInuts or olyIcooks, when freshb Ihey
have such an eatable look that the most selfIdenying stranger can hardly
keep his hands offb

 ut what further depreciates the whale as a civiliced dish, is his
esceeding richnessb  e is the great price os of the sea, too fat to be
delicately goodb rook at his hump, which would be as fine eating as
the buffalo s iwhich is esteemed a rare dishi, were it not such a solid
pyramid of fatb  ut the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that
is  like the transparent, halfIeellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the
third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for
butterb severtheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into
some other substance, and then partaking of itb bn the long try
watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their
shipIbiscuit into the huge oilIpots and let them fry there awhileb  any
a good supper have b thus madeb

bn the case of a small operm uhale the brains are accounted a fine dishb
Ihe casket of the skull is broken into with an ase, and the two plump,

they are then mised with flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess,
in flavor somewhat resembling calves  head, which is buite a dish among
some epicures  and every one knows that some young bucks among the
epicures, by continually dining upon calves  brains, by and by get to
have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to tell a
calf s head from their own heads  which, indeed, rebuires uncommon
discriminationb rnd that is the reason why a young buck with an
intelligent looking calf s head before him, is somehow one of the
saddest sights you can seeb Ihe head looks a sort of reproachfully at
him, with an  st tu  rutes  espressionb

bt is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so escessively
unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence 
that appears to result, in some way, from the consideration before
mentionedI ibeb that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea,
and eat it too by its own lightb  ut no doubt the first man that ever
murdered an os was regarded as a murderer  perhaps he was hung  and if
he had been put on his trial by osen, he certainly would have been  and
he certainly deserved it if any murderer doesb  o to the meatImarket

s r
Is  iib Ihe ohark  assacreb


uhen in the oouthern rishery, a captured operm uhale, after long and
weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general
thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting
him inb ror that business is an esceedingly laborious one  is not very
soon completed  and rebuires all hands to set about itb Iherefore, the
common usage is to take in all sail  lash the helm a lee  and then send
every one below to his hammock till daylight, with the reservation that,
until that time, anchorIwatches shall be kept  that is, two and two for
an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see
that all goes wellb

 ut sometimes, especially upon the rine in the 
acific, this plan will
not answer at all  because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather
round the moored carcase, that were he left so for sis hours, say, on a
stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by morningb
bn most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so
largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably
diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whalingIspades,
a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to
tickle them into still greater activityb  ut it was not thus in the
present case with the 
ebuod s sharks  though, to be sure, any man
unaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side that night,
would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and
those sharks the maggots in itb

severtheless, upon otubb setting the anchorIwatch after his supper was
concluded  and when, accordingly, eueebueg and a forecastle seaman
came on deck, no small escitement was created among the sharks  for
immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering
three lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid
sea, these two mariners, darting their long whalingIspades, kept up an
incessant murdering of the sharks,i by striking the keen steel deep
into their skulls, seemingly their only vital partb  ut in the foamy
confusion of their mised and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not
always hit their mark  and this brought about new revelations of the
incredible ferocity of the foeb Ihey viciously snapped, not only at each
other s disembowelments, but like flesible bows, bent round, and bit
their own  till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by
the same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping woundb sor was
this allb bt was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these
creaturesb r sort of generic or 
antheistic vitality seemed to lurk in
their very eoints and bones, after what might be called the individual
life had departedb nilled and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin,
one of these sharks almost took poor eueebueg s hand off, when he tried
to shut down the dead lid of his murderous eawb


iIhe whalingIspade used for cuttingIin is made of the very best steel 
is about the bigness of a man s spread hand  and in general shape,
corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named  only its
sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than
the lowerb Ihis weapon is always kept as sharp as possible  and when
being used is occasionally honed, eust like a racorb bn its socket, a
stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handleb


 eueebueg no care what god made him shark,  said the savage, agonicingly
lifting his hand up and down   wedder reeee god or santucket god  but de
god wat made shark must be one dam bnginb

bt was a oaturday night, and such a oabbath as followeds ss officio
professors of oabbath breaking are all whalemenb Ihe ivory 
ebuod was
turned into what seemed a shamble  every sailor a butcherb eou would
have thought we were offering up ten thousand red osen to the sea godsb

bn the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous
things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and which
no single man can possibly liftIIthis vast bunch of grapes was swayed up
to the mainItop and firmly lashed to the lower mastIhead, the strongest
point anywhere above a ship s deckb Ihe end of the hawserIlike rope
winding through these intricacies, was then conducted to the windlass,
and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale  to
this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one hundred pounds, was
attachedb rnd now suspended in stages over the side, otarbuck and otubb,
the mates, armed with their long spades, began cutting a hole in the
body for the insertion of the hook eust above the nearest of the two
sideIfinsb Ihis done, a broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole,
the hook is inserted, and the main body of the crew striking up a wild
chorus, now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlassb uhen
instantly, the entire ship careens over on her side  every bolt in
her starts like the nailIheads of an old house in frosty weather  she
trembles, buivers, and nods her frighted mastIheads to the skyb  ore
and more she leans over to the whale, while every gasping heave of the
windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows  till at last,
a swift, startling snap is heard  with a great swash the ship rolls
upwards and backwards from the whale, and the triumphant tackle rises
into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the
first strip of blubberb sow as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely
as the rind does an orange, so is it stripped off from the body
precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralicing itb ror the
strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale
rolling over and over in the water, and as the blubber in one strip
uniformly peels off along the line called the  scarf,  simultaneously
cut by the spades of otarbuck and otubb, the mates  and eust as fast as
it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very act itself, it is all the
time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end graces the
mainItop  the men at the windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment
or two the prodigious bloodIdripping mass sways to and fro as if let
down from the sky, and every one present must take good heed to dodge
it when it swings, else it may bos his ears and pitch him headlong
overboardb

ene of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon
called a boardingIsword, and watching his chance he desterously slices
out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying massb bnto this
hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked
so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for what
followsb uhereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands to
stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a few
sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in twain 
so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip,
called a blanketIpiece, swings clear, and is all ready for loweringb
Ihe heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is
peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly
slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway
right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubberIroomb bnto
this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long
blanketIpiece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpentsb
rnd thus the work proceeds  the two tackles hoisting and lowering
simultaneously  both whale and windlass heaving, the heavers singing,
the blubberIroom gentlemen coiling, the mates scarfing, the ship
straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by way of assuaging the
general frictionb



s r
Is  i b Ihe  lanketb


b have given no small attention to that not unvesed subeect, the skin of
the whaleb b have had controversies about it with esperienced whalemen
afloat, and learned naturalists ashoreb  y original opinion remains
unchanged  but it is only an opinionb

Ihe buestion is, what and where is the skin of the whalen rlready you
know what his blubber isb Ihat blubber is something of the consistence
of firm, closeIgrained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and
ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thicknessb

sow, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature s
skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point
of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption  because you
cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale s body but
that same blubber  and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal, if
reasonably dense, what can that be but the skinn Irue, from the unmarred
dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely
thin, transparent substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds
of isinglass, only it is almost as flesible and soft as satin  that is,
previous to being dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but
becomes rather hard and brittleb b have several such dried bits, which
b use for marks in my whaleIbooksb bt is transparent, as b said before 
and being laid upon the printed page, b have sometimes pleased myself
with fancying it eserted a magnifying influenceb rt any rate, it is
pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles, as you may
sayb  ut what b am driving at here is thisb Ihat same infinitely thin,
isinglass substance, which, b admit, invests the entire body of the
whale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature, as
the skin of the skin, so to speak  for it were simply ridiculous to say,
that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender
than the skin of a newIborn childb  ut no more of thisb

rssuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale  then, when this skin,
as in the case of a very large operm uhale, will yield the bulk of one
hundred barrels of oil  and, when it is considered that, in buantity, or
rather weight, that oil, in its espressed state, is only three fourths,
and not the entire substance of the coat  some idea may hence be had
of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose mere
integument yields such a lake of libuid as thatb  eckoning ten barrels
to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three buarters
of the stuff of the whale s skinb

bn life, the visible surface of the operm uhale is not the least among
the many marvels he presentsb rlmost invariably it is all over oblibuely
crossed and reIcrossed with numberless straight marks in thick array,
something like those in the finest btalian line engravingsb  ut these
marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above
mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as if they were engraved
upon the body itselfb sor is this allb bn some instances, to the buick,
observant eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but
afford the ground for far other delineationsb Ihese are hieroglyphical 
that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids
hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present
connesionb  y my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one operm
uhale in particular, b was much struck with a plate representing the old
bndian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on
the banks of the bpper  ississippib rike those mystic rocks, too, the
mysticImarked whale remains undecipherableb Ihis allusion to the bndian
rocks reminds me of another thingb  esides all the other phenomena which
the esterior of the operm uhale presents, he not seldom displays the
back, and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the
regular linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches,
altogether of an irregular, random aspectb b should say that those sew
sngland rocks on the seaIcoast, which rgassic imagines to bear the marks
of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergsIIb should say,
that those rocks must not a little resemble the operm uhale in this
particularb bt also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are
probably made by hostile contact with other whales  for b have most
remarked them in the large, fullIgrown bulls of the speciesb

r word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of
the whaleb bt has already been said, that it is stript from him in long
pieces, called blanketIpiecesb rike most seaIterms, this one is very
happy and significantb ror the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber
as in a real blanket or counterpane  or, still better, an bndian poncho
slipt over his head, and skirting his estremityb bt is by reason of this
cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself
comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tidesb uhat would
become of a  reenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy seas of the
sorth, if unsupplied with his cosy surtoutn Irue, other fish are
found esceedingly brisk in those  yperborean waters  but these, be it
observed, are your coldIblooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies
are refrigerators  creatures, that warm themselves under the lee of
an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire 
whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm bloodb rreece his blood,
and he diesb  ow wonderful is it thenIIescept after esplanationIIthat
this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it
is to man  how wonderful that he should be found at home, immersed
to his lips for life in those rrctic waterss where, when seamen fall
overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly
frocen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued
in amberb  ut more surprising is it to know, as has been proved by
esperiment, that the blood of a 
olar whale is warmer than that of a
 orneo negro in summerb

bt does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong
individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare
virtue of interior spaciousnessb eh, mans admire and model thyself after
the whales ro thou, too, remain warm among iceb ro thou, too, live in
this world without being of itb  e cool at the ebuator  keep thy blood
fluid at the 
oleb rike the great dome of otb 
eter s, and like the
great whale, retain, e mans in all seasons a temperature of thine ownb

bt should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping
the body of the leviathan, he was beheadedb sow, the beheading of the
operm uhale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which esperienced
whale surgeons very much pride themselvesI and not without reasonb

sonsider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck 
on the contrary, where his head and body seem to eoin, there, in that
very place, is the thickest part of himb  emember, also, that the
surgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening
between him and his subeect, and that subeect almost hidden in a
discoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting seab  ear
in mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many
feet deep in the flesh  and in that subterraneous manner, without so
much as getting one single peep into the everIcontracting gash thus
made, he must skilfully steer clear of all adeacent, interdicted parts,
and esactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion
into the skullb ro you not marvel, then, at otubb s boast, that he
demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whalen

uhen first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable
till the body is strippedb Ihat done, if it belong to a small whale
it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed ofb  ut, with a full
grown leviathan this is impossible  for the sperm whale s head embraces
nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend such a
burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this were as
vain a thing as to attempt weighing a rutch barn in eewellers  scalesb

Ihe 
ebuod s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head was
hoisted against the ship s sideIIabout half way out of the sea, so that
it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native elementb rnd there
with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of the
enormous downward drag from the lower mastIhead, and every yardIarm
on that side proeecting like a crane over the waves  there, that
bloodIdripping head hung to the 
ebuod s waist like the giant
 olofernes s from the girdle of iudithb

uhen this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went
below to their dinnerb oilence reigned over the before tumultuous but
now deserted deckb rn intense copper calm, like a universal yellow
lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon
the seab

r short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came rhab alone
from his cabinb Iaking a few turns on the buarterIdeck, he paused to
gace over the side, then slowly getting into the mainIchains he
took otubb s long spadeIIstill remaining there after the whale s

Is  d b Ihe ieroboam s otoryb


 and in hand, ship and breece blew on  but the breece came faster than
the ship, and soon the 
ebuod began to rockb

 y and by, through the glass the stranger s boats and manned mastIheads
proved her a whaleIshipb  ut as she was so far to windward, and shooting
by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the 
ebuod could
not hope to reach herb oo the signal was set to see what response would
be madeb

 ere be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships of
the rmerican uhale rleet have each a private signal  all which signals
being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels
attached, every captain is provided with itb Ihereby, the whale
commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at
considerable distances and with no small facilityb

Ihe 
ebuod s signal was at last responded to by the stranger s setting
her own  which proved the ship to be the ieroboam of santucketb obuaring
her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the 
ebuod s lee, and
lowered a boat  it soon drew nigh  but, as the sideIladder was being
rigged by otarbuck s order to accommodate the visiting captain, the
stranger in buestion waved his hand from his boat s stern in token
of that proceeding being entirely unnecessaryb bt turned out that
the ieroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that  ayhew, her
captain, was fearful of infecting the 
ebuod s companyb ror, though
himself and boat s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was half
a rifleIshot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing
between  yet conscientiously adhering to the timid buarantine of the
land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the

ebuodb

 ut this did by no means prevent all communicationsb 
reserving an
interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the ieroboam s
boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the

ebuod, as she heavily forged through the sea ifor by this time it blew
very freshi, with her mainItopsail aback  though, indeed, at times by
the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed some
way ahead  but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings
againb oubeect to this, and other the like interruptions now and then, a
conversation was sustained between the two parties  but at intervals not
without still another interruption of a very different sortb


ulling an oar in the ieroboam s boat, was a man of a singular
appearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities
make up all totalitiesb  e was a small, short, youngish man, sprinkled
all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant yellow hairb r
longIskirted, cabalisticallyIcut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped
him  the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wristsb r
deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyesb

oo soon as this figure had been first descried, otubb had
esclaimedII Ihat s hes that s hesIIthe longItogged scaramouch the
IownI o s company told us ofs  otubb here alluded to a strange story
told of the ieroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time
previous when the 
ebuod spoke the IownI ob rccording to this account
and what was subsebuently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in
buestion had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the
ieroboamb  is story was thisI

 e had been originally nurtured among the cracy society of seskyeuna
ohakers, where he had been a great prophet  in their cracked, secret
meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a
trapIdoor, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he
carried in his vestIpocket  but, which, instead of containing gunpowder,
was supposed to be charged with laudanumb r strange, apostolic whim
having seiced him, he had left seskyeuna for santucket, where, with
that cunning peculiar to craciness, he assumed a steady, commonIsense
esterior, and offered himself as a greenIhand candidate for the
ieroboam s whaling voyageb Ihey engaged him  but straightway upon
the ship s getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in a
freshetb  e announced himself as the archangel  abriel, and commanded
the captain to eump overboardb  e published his manifesto, whereby
he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and
vicarIgeneral of all eceanicab Ihe unflinching earnestness with which he
declared these things IIthe dark, daring play of his sleepless, escited
imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium, united
to invest this  abriel in the minds of the maeority of the ignorant
crew, with an atmosphere of sacrednessb  oreover, they were afraid of
himb rs such a man, however, was not of much practical use in the ship,
especially as he refused to work escept when he pleased, the incredulous
captain would fain have been rid of him  but apprised that that
individual s intention was to land him in the first convenient port, the
archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vialsIIdevoting the ship
and all hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention was
carried outb oo strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew,
that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if  abriel
was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remainb  e was therefore
forced to relinbuish his planb sor would they permit  abriel to be any
way maltreated, say or do what he would  so that it came to pass that
 abriel had the complete freedom of the shipb Ihe consebuence of all
this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and
mates  and since the epidemic had broken out, he carried a higher hand
than ever  declaring that the plague, as he called it, was at his sole
command  nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasureb
Ihe sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before
him  in obedience to his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal
homage, as to a godb ouch things may seem incredible  but, however
wondrous, they are trueb sor is the history of fanatics half so striking
in respect to the measureless selfIdeception of the fanatic himself, as
his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many othersb  ut
it is time to return to the

  abriels  abriels  cried saptain  ayhew   thou must eitherII   ut
that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings
drowned all speechb

  ast thou seen the uhite uhalen  demanded rhab, when the boat drifted
backb

 Ihink, think of thy whaleIboat, stoven and sunks  eware of the horrible
tails 

 b tell thee again,  abriel, thatII   ut again the boat tore ahead as if
dragged by fiendsb sothing was said for some moments, while a succession
of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional caprices
of the seas were tumbling, not heaving itb  eantime, the hoisted sperm
whale s head eogged about very violently, and  abriel was seen eyeing
it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to
warrantb

uhen this interlude was over, saptain  ayhew began a dark story
concerning  oby rick  not, however, without frebuent interruptions from
 abriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the cracy sea that seemed
leagued with himb

bt seemed that the ieroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking
a whaleIship, her people were reliably apprised of the esistence of  oby
rick, and the havoc he had madeb  reedily sucking in this intelligence,
 abriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the uhite
uhale, in case the monster should be seen  in his gibbering insanity,
pronouncing the uhite uhale to be no less a being than the ohaker  od
incarnated  the ohakers receiving the  ibleb  ut when, some year or two
afterwards,  oby rick was fairly sighted from the mastIheads,  acey, the
chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him  and the captain himself
being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity, despite all
the archangel s denunciations and forewarnings,  acey succeeded in
persuading five men to man his boatb uith them he pushed off  and, after
much weary pulling, and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last
succeeded in getting one iron fastb  eantime,  abriel, ascending to
the mainIroyal mastIhead, was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and
hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants
of his divinityb sow, while  acey, the mate, was standing up in his
boat s bow, and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting
his wild esclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance
for his poised lance, los a broad white shadow rose from the sea  by its
buick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies
of the oarsmenb sest instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious
life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc in his
descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yardsb sot a
chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman s head  but the
mate for ever sankb

bt is well to parenthesice here, that of the fatal accidents in the
opermIuhale rishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frebuent as anyb
oometimes, nothing is ineured but the man who is thus annihilated 
oftener the boat s bow is knocked off, or the thighIboard, in which the
headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the bodyb  ut
strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one,
when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is
discernible  the man being stark deadb

Ihe whole calamity, with the falling form of  acey, was plainly descried
from the shipb  aising a piercing shriekII Ihe vials the vials   abriel
called off the terrorIstricken crew from the further hunting of the
whaleb Ihis terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence 
because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically
foreIannounced it, instead of only making a general prophecy, which any
one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the
wide margin allowedb  e became a nameless terror to the shipb

 ayhew having concluded his narration, rhab put such buestions to
him, that the stranger captain could not forbear inbuiring whether he
intended to hunt the uhite uhale, if opportunity should offerb Io which
rhab answeredII ryeb  otraightway, then,  abriel once more started
to his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently esclaimed, with
downward pointed fingerII Ihink, think of the blasphemerIIdead, and down
theresIIbeware of the blasphemer s ends 

rhab stolidly turned aside  then said to  ayhew,  saptain, b have
eust bethought me of my letterIbag  there is a letter for one of thy
officers, if b mistake notb otarbuck, look over the bagb 

svery whaleIship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships,
whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed, depends
upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceansb Ihus,
most letters never reach their mark  and many are only received after
attaining an age of two or three years or moreb

ooon otarbuck returned with a letter in his handb bt was sorely tumbled,
damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in consebuence
of being kept in a dark locker of the cabinb ef such a letter, reath
himself might well have been the postIboyb

 san st not read itn  cried rhabb   ive it me, manb rye, aye, it s but
a dim scrawl IIwhat s thisn  rs he was studying it out, otarbuck took a
long cuttingIspade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to
insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without
its coming any closer to the shipb

 eantime, rhab holding the letter, muttered,   rb  arIIyes,  rb
 arryIIia woman s pinny hand,IIthe man s wife, b ll wageriIIryeII rb
 arry  acey, ohip ieroboam IIwhy it s  acey, and he s deads 

 
oor fellows poor fellows and from his wife,  sighed  ayhew   but let
me have itb 

 say, keep it thyself,  cried  abriel to rhab   thou art soon going that
wayb 

 surses throttle thees  yelled rhabb  saptain  ayhew, stand by now to
receive it   and taking the fatal missive from otarbuck s hands, he
caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boatb
 ut as he did so, the oarsmen espectantly desisted from rowing  the boat
drifted a little towards the ship s stern  so that, as if by magic, the
letter suddenly ranged along with  abriel s eager handb  e clutched it
in an instant, seiced the boatIknife, and impaling the letter on it,
sent it thus loaded back into the shipb bt fell at rhab s feetb Ihen
 abriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars, and in
that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the 
ebuodb

rs, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the eacket
of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild
affairb



s r
Is  ddb Ihe  onkeyI opeb


bn the tumultuous business of cuttingIin and attending to a whale, there
is much running backwards and forwards among the crewb sow hands are
wanted here, and then again hands are wanted thereb Ihere is no staying
in any one place  for at one and the same time everything has to be done
everywhereb bt is much the same with him who endeavors the description
of the sceneb ue must now retrace our way a littleb bt was mentioned
that upon first breaking ground in the whale s back, the blubberIhook
was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the
matesb  ut how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook
get fised in that holen bt was inserted there by my particular friend
eueebueg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the
monster s back for the special purpose referred tob  ut in very many
cases, circumstances rebuire that the harpooneer shall remain on the
whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concludedb Ihe
whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, escepting the
immediate parts operated uponb oo down there, some ten feet below the
level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the
whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a treadImill
beneath himb en the occasion in buestion, eueebueg figured in the
 ighland costumeIIa shirt and socksIIin which to my eyes, at least,
he appeared to uncommon advantage  and no one had a better chance to
observe him, as will presently be seenb

 eing the savage s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bowIoar
in his boat ithe second one from forwardi, it was my cheerful duty to
attend upon him while taking that hardIscrabble scramble upon the dead
whale s backb eou have seen btalian organIboys holding a dancingIape by
a long cordb iust so, from the ship s steep side, did b hold eueebueg
down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery
a monkeyIrope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his
waistb

bt was a humorously perilous business for both of usb ror, before we
proceed further, it must be said that the monkeyIrope was fast at
both ends  fast to eueebueg s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow
leather oneb oo that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were
wedded  and should poor eueebueg sink to rise no more, then both usage
and honour demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag
me down in his wakeb oo, then, an elongated oiamese ligature united usb
eueebueg was my own inseparable twin brother  nor could b any way get
rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailedb

oo strongly and metaphysically did b conceive of my situation then, that
while earnestly watching his motions, b seemed distinctly to perceive
that my own individuality was now merged in a eoint stock company of
two  that my free will had received a mortal wound  and that another s
mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster
and deathb Iherefore, b saw that here was a sort of interregnum in

rovidence  for its evenIhanded ebuity never could have so gross an
ineusticeb rnd yet still further ponderingIIwhile b eerked him now
and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten to eam
himIIstill further pondering, b say, b saw that this situation of mine
was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes  only, in most
cases, he, one way or other, has this oiamese connesion with a plurality
of other mortalsb bf your banker breaks, you snap  if your apothecary by
mistake sends you poison in your pills, you dieb Irue, you may say
that, by esceeding caution, you may possibly escape these and the
multitudinous other evil chances of lifeb  ut handle eueebueg s
monkeyIrope heedfully as b would, sometimes he eerked it so, that b came
very near sliding overboardb sor could b possibly forget that, do what b
would, b only had the management of one end of itbi


iIhe monkeyIrope is found in all whalers  but it was only in the 
ebuod
that the monkey and his holder were ever tied togetherb Ihis improvement
upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than otubb,
in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible
guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkeyIrope holderb


b have hinted that b would often eerk poor eueebueg from between the
whale and the shipIIwhere he would occasionally fall, from the incessant
rolling and swaying of bothb  ut this was not the only eamming eeopardy
he was esposed tob bnappalled by the massacre made upon them during the
night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent
blood which began to flow from the carcassIIthe rabid creatures swarmed
round it like bees in a beehiveb

rnd right in among those sharks was eueebueg  who often pushed them
aside with his floundering feetb r thing altogether incredible were
it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise
miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a manb

severtheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a
ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to themb
rccordingly, besides the monkeyIrope, with which b now and then eerked
the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed
a peculiarly ferocious sharkIIhe was provided with still another
protectionb ouspended over the side in one of the stages, Iashtego
and raggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen
whaleIspades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could
reachb Ihis procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and
benevolent of themb Ihey meant eueebueg s best happiness, b admit  but
in their hasty ceal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both
he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the bloodImuddled water,
those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg
than a tailb  ut poor eueebueg, b suppose, straining and gasping there
with that great iron hookIIpoor eueebueg, b suppose, only prayed to his
eoeo, and gave up his life into the hands of his godsb

uell, well, my dear comrade and twinIbrother, thought b, as b drew in
and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the seaIIwhat matters
it, after alln rre you not the precious image of each and all of us men
in this whaling worldn Ihat unsounded ocean you gasp in, is rife  those
sharks, your foes  those spades, your friends  and what between sharks
and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor ladb

 ut courages there is good cheer in store for you, eueebuegb ror now, as
with blue lips and bloodIshot eyes the eshausted savage at last climbs
up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over
the side  the steward advances, and with a benevolent, consolatory
glance hands himIIwhatn oome hot sognacn sos hands him, ye godss hands
him a cup of tepid ginger and waters

  ingern ro b smell gingern  suspiciously asked otubb, coming nearb
 ees, this must be ginger,  peering into the as yet untasted cupb Ihen
standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the
astonished steward slowly saying,   ingern gingern and will you have
the goodness to tell me,  rb roughI oy, where lies the virtue of gingern
 ingers is ginger the sort of fuel you use, roughIboy, to kindle a fire

 Ihere is some sneaking Iemperance oociety movement about this
business,  he suddenly added, now approaching otarbuck, who had eust
come from forwardb  uill you look at that kannakin, sir  smell of it,
if you pleaseb  Ihen watching the mate s countenance, he added,  Ihe
steward,  rb otarbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and ealap
to eueebueg, there, this instant off the whaleb bs the steward an
apothecary, sirn and may b ask whether this is the sort of bitters by
which he blows back the life into a halfIdrowned mann 

 b trust not,  said otarbuck,  it is poor stuff enoughb 

 rye, aye, steward,  cried otubb,  we ll teach you to drug a
harpooneer  none of your apothecary s medicine here  you want to poison
us, do yen eou have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder
us all, and pocket the proceeds, do yen 

 bt was not me,  cried roughI oy,  it was runt sharity that brought the
ginger on board  and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits, but
only this gingerIeubIIso she called itb 

  ingerIeubs you gingerly rascals take thats and run along with ye

otarbuckb bt is the captain s ordersIIgrog for the harpooneer on a

 eh, b never hurt when b hit, escept when b hit a whale or something of
that sort  and this fellow s a weacelb uhat were you about saying, sirn 

 enly thisI go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyselfb 

uhen otubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort
of teaIcaddy in the otherb Ihe first contained strong spirits, and was
handed to eueebueg  the second was runt sharity s gift, and that was
freely given to the wavesb



s r
Is  d b otubb and rlask nill a  ight uhale  and Ihen  ave a Ialk
ever  imb


bt must be borne in mind that all this time we have a operm uhale s
prodigious head hanging to the 
ebuod s sideb  ut we must let it
continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to itb
ror the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for the
head, is to pray heaven the tackles may holdb

sow, during the past night and forenoon, the 
ebuod had gradually
drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,
gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of  ight uhales, a species of the
reviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking
anywhere nearb rnd though all hands commonly disdained the capture of
those inferior creatures  and though the 
ebuod was not commissioned to
cruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near
the srocetts without lowering a boat  yet now that a operm uhale
had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the
announcement was made that a  ight uhale should be captured that day, if
opportunity offeredb

sor was this long wantingb Iall spouts were seen to leeward  and two
boats, otubb s and rlask s, were detached in pursuitb 
ulling further
and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at
the mastIheadb  ut suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of
tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or
both the boats must be fastb rn interval passed and the boats were in
plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the
towing whaleb oo close did the monster come to the hull, that at
first it seemed as if he meant it malice  but suddenly going down in a
maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from
view, as if diving under the keelb  sut, cuts  was the cry from the
ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being
brought with a deadly dash against the vessel s sideb  ut having plenty
of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they
paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their
might so as to get ahead of the shipb ror a few minutes the struggle was
intensely critical  for while they still slacked out the tightened line
in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the contending
strain threatened to take them underb  ut it was only a few feet advance
they sought to gainb rnd they stuck to it till they did gain it  when
instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the
keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose
to view under her bows, snapping and buivering  and so flinging off its
drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water,
while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were
free to flyb  ut the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering
his course, went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after
him, so that they performed a complete circuitb

 eantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close
flanking him on both sides, otubb answered rlask with lance for
lance  and thus round and round the 
ebuod the battle went, while the
multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the operm uhale s body,
rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every
new gash, as the eager bsraelites did at the new bursting fountains that
poured from the smitten rockb

rt last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he
turned upon his back a corpseb

uhile the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,
and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some
conversation ensued between themb

 b wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,  said
otubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so
ignoble a leviathanb

 uants with itn  said rlask, coiling some spare line in the boat s bow,
 did you never hear that the ship which but once has a operm uhale s
head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a  ight uhale s
on the larboard  did you never hear, otubb, that that ship can never
afterwards capsicen 

 uhy notn

 b don t know, but b heard that gamboge ghost of a redallah saying so,
and he seems to know all about ships  charmsb  ut b sometimes think
he ll charm the ship to no good at lastb b don t half like that chap,
otubbb rid you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into
a snake s head, otubbn 

 oink hims b never look at him at all  but if ever b get a chance of a
dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by  look

both handsII rye, will bs rlask, b take that redallah to be the devil in
disguiseb ro you believe that cock and bull story about his having been
stowed away on board shipn  e s the devil, b sayb Ihe reason why you
don t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight  he carries
it coiled away in his pocket, b guessb  last hims now that b think of
it, he s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his bootsb 

  e sleeps in his boots, don t hen  e hasn t got any hammock  but b ve
seen him lay of nights in a coil of riggingb 

 so doubt, and it s because of his cursed tail  he coils it down, do ye
see, in the eye of the riggingb 

 uhat s the old man have so much to do with him forn 

 otriking up a swap or a bargain, b supposeb 

  argainnIIabout whatn 

 uhy, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that uhite uhale, and
the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away
his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then he ll
surrender  oby rickb 

 
oohs otubb, you are skylarking  how can redallah do thatn 

 b don t know, rlask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked
one, b tell yeb uhy, they say as how he went a sauntering into the
old flagIship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and
gentlemanlike, and inbuiring if the old governor was at homeb uell, he
was at home, and asked the devil what he wantedb Ihe devil, switching
his hoofs, up and says,  b want iohnb   uhat forn  says the old
governorb  uhat business is that of yours,  says the devil, getting
mad,II b want to use himb   Iake him,  says the governorIIand by the

he got through with him, b ll eat this whale in one mouthfulb  ut look

towards the ship,  but b can t remember whereb

here,  eelcebub, you don t do it  and if he makes any fuss, by the rord
b ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan,
and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come short
off at the stumpIIdo you see  and then, b rather guess when he finds
himself docked in that bueer fashion, he ll sneak off without the poor
satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legsb 

 rnd what will you do with the tail, otubbn 

 ro with itn oell it for an os whip when we get home IIwhat elsen 

 sow, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, otubbn 

  ean or not mean, here we are at the shipb 

Ihe boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where
fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing
himb

 ridn t b tell you son  said rlask   yes, you ll soon see this right
whale s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti sb 

bn good time, rlask s saying proved trueb rs before, the 
ebuod steeply
leaned over towards the sperm whale s head, now, by the counterpoise of
both heads, she regained her even keel  though sorely strained, you may
well believeb oo, when on one side you hoist in rocke s head, you go
over that way  but now, on the other side, hoist in nant s and you come
back again  but in very poor plightb Ihus, some minds for ever keep
trimming boatb eh, ye foolishs throw all these thunderIheads overboard,
and then you will float light and rightb

bn disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the
ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the
case of a sperm whale  only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off
whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and
hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to what is
called the crownIpieceb  ut nothing like this, in the present case,
had been doneb Ihe carcases of both whales had dropped astern  and
the headIladen ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of
overburdening panniersb

 eantime, redallah was calmly eyeing the right whale s head, and ever
and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own
handb rnd rhab chanced so to stand, that the 
arsee occupied his shadow 
while, if the 
arsee s shadow was there at all it seemed only to
blend with, and lengthen rhab sb rs the crew toiled on, raplandish
speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing
thingsb



s r
Is  d b Ihe operm uhale s  eadIIsontrasted iiewb


 ere, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together  let us
eoin them, and lay together our ownb

ef the grand order of folio leviathans, the operm uhale and the  ight
uhale are by far the most noteworthyb Ihey are the only whales regularly
hunted by manb Io the santucketer, they present the two estremes of all
the known varieties of the whaleb rs the esternal difference between
them is mainly observable in their heads  and as a head of each is this
moment hanging from the 
ebuod s side  and as we may freely go from one
to the other, by merely stepping across the deckIIIwhere, b should like
to know, will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology
than heren

bn the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these
headsb  oth are massive enough in all conscience  but there is a certain
mathematical symmetry in the operm uhale s which the  ight uhale s sadly
lacksb Ihere is more character in the operm uhale s headb rs you behold
it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point
of pervading dignityb bn the present instance, too, this dignity is
heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit,
giving token of advanced age and large esperienceb bn short, he is what
the fishermen technically call a  greyIheaded whaleb 

ret us now note what is least dissimilar in these headsIInamely, the two
most important organs, the eye and the earb rar back on the side of
the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale s eaw, if you
narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would
fancy to be a young colt s eye  so out of all proportion is it to the
magnitude of the headb

sow, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale s eyes, it is
plain that he can never see an obeect which is esactly ahead, no more
than he can one esactly asternb bn a word, the position of the whale s
eyes corresponds to that of a man s ears  and you may fancy, for
yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey obeects
through your earsb eou would find that you could only command some
thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight sideIline of sight 
and about thirty more behind itb bf your bitterest foe were walking
straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not
be able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from
behindb bn a word, you would have two backs, so to speak  but, at the
same time, also, two fronts iside frontsiI for what is it that makes the
front of a manIIwhat, indeed, but his eyesn

 oreover, while in most other animals that b can now think of, the eyes
are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to
produce one picture and not two to the brain  the peculiar position of
the whale s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of
solid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating
two lakes in valleys  this, of course, must wholly separate the
impressions which each independent organ impartsb Ihe whale, therefore,
must see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct
picture on that side  while all between must be profound darkness and
nothingness to himb  an may, in effect, be said to look out on the world
from a sentryIbos with two eoined sashes for his windowb  ut with the
whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two distinct
windows, but sadly impairing the viewb Ihis peculiarity of the whale s
eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery  and to be
remembered by the reader in some subsebuent scenesb

r curious and most puccling buestion might be started concerning this
visual matter as touching the reviathanb  ut b must be content with a
hintb oo long as a man s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing
is involuntary  that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing
whatever obeects are before himb severtheless, any one s esperience
will teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of
things at one glance, it is buite impossible for him, attentively,
and completely, to esamine any two thingsIIhowever large or however
smallIIat one and the same instant of time  never mind if they lie side
by side and touch each otherb  ut if you now come to separate these two
obeects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness  then, in
order to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to
bear on it, the other will be utterly escluded from your contemporary
consciousnessb  ow is it, then, with the whalen Irue, both his eyes,
in themselves, must simultaneously act  but is his brain so much more
comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man s, that he can at the same
moment of time attentively esamine two distinct prospects, one on one
side of him, and the other in an esactly opposite directionn bf he
can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able
simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems
in suclidb sor, strictly investigated, is there any incongruity in this
comparisonb

bt may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the
estraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when
beset by three or four boats  the timidity and liability to bueer
frights, so common to such whales  b think that all this indirectly
proceeds from the helpless perplesity of volition, in which their
divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve themb

 ut the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eyeb bf you are an
entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads
for hours, and never discover that organb Ihe ear has no esternal leaf
whatever  and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a buill, so
wondrously minute is itb bt is lodged a little behind the eyeb uith
respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed
between the sperm whale and the rightb uhile the ear of the former has
an esternal opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered
over with a membrane, so as to be buite imperceptible from withoutb

bs it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the
world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which
is smaller than a hare sn  ut if his eyes were broad as the lens of
 erschel s great telescope  and his ears capacious as the porches of
cathedrals  would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of
hearingn sot at allbIIuhy then do you try to  enlarge  your mindn
oubtilice itb

ret us now with whatever levers and steamIengines we have at hand, cant
over the sperm whale s head, that it may lie bottom up  then, ascending
by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth  and were it not
that the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we
might descend into the great nentucky  ammoth save of his stomachb  ut
let us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we areb uhat
a really beautiful and chasteIlooking mouths from floor to ceiling,
lined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as
bridal satinsb

 ut come out now, and look at this portentous lower eaw, which seems
like the long narrow lid of an immense snuffIbos, with the hinge at one
end, instead of one sideb bf you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,
and espose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis  and such,
alass it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these
spikes fall with impaling forceb  ut far more terrible is it to behold,
when fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there
suspended, with his prodigious eaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging
straight down at rightIangles with his body, for all the world like a
ship s eibIboomb Ihis whale is not dead  he is only dispirited  out of
sorts, perhaps  hypochondriac  and so supine, that the hinges of his
eaw have relased, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a
reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lockIeaws upon
himb

bn most cases this lower eawIIbeing easily unhinged by a practised
artistIIis disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of estracting
the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone
with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,
including canes, umbrellaIstocks, and handles to ridingIwhipsb

uith a long, weary hoist the eaw is dragged on board, as if it were an
anchor  and when the proper time comesIIsome few days after the other
workIIeueebueg, raggoo, and Iashtego, being all accomplished dentists,
are set to drawing teethb uith a keen cuttingIspade, eueebueg lances
the gums  then the eaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being
rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as  ichigan osen drag
stumps of old oaks out of wild wood landsb Ihere are generally fortyItwo
teeth in all  in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed  nor filled
after our artificial fashionb Ihe eaw is afterwards sawn into slabs, and
piled away like eoists for building housesb



s r
Is  ddb Ihe  ight uhale s  eadIIsontrasted iiewb


srossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the  ight uhale s
headb

rs in general shape the noble operm uhale s head may be compared to a
 oman warIchariot iespecially in front, where it is so broadly roundedi 
so, at a broad view, the  ight uhale s head bears a rather inelegant
resemblance to a gigantic galliotItoed shoeb Iwo hundred years ago an
old rutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker s lastb rnd
in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the nursery tale, with
the swarming brood, might very comfortably be lodged, she and all her
progenyb

 ut as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different
aspects, according to your point of viewb bf you stand on its summit and
look at these two rIshaped spoutholes, you would take the whole head
for an enormous bassIviol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its
soundingIboardb Ihen, again, if you fis your eye upon this strange,
crested, combIlike incrustation on the top of the massIIthis green,
barnacled thing, which the  reenlanders call the  crown,  and the
oouthern fishers the  bonnet  of the  ight uhale  fising your eyes
solely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,
with a bird s nest in its crotchb rt any rate, when you watch those live
crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost
sure to occur to you  unless, indeed, your fancy has been fised by the
technical term  crown  also bestowed upon it  in which case you will
take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a
diademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for
him in this marvellous mannerb  ut if this whale be a king, he is a very
sulky looking fellow to grace a diademb rook at that hanging lower lips
what a huge sulk and pout is theres a sulk and pout, by carpenter s
measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep  a sulk and pout
that will yield you some dnn gallons of oil and moreb

r great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hareIlippedb
Ihe fissure is about a foot acrossb 
robably the mother during an
important interval was sailing down the 
eruvian coast, when earthbuakes
caused the beach to gapeb ever this lip, as over a slippery threshold,
we now slide into the mouthb bpon my word were b at  ackinaw, b should
take this to be the inside of an bndian wigwamb  ood rords is this the
road that ionah wentn Ihe roof is about twelve feet high, and runs to a
pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular ridgeIpole there  while
these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us with those wondrous, half
vertical, scimetarIshaped slats of whalebone, say three hundred on a
side, which depending from the upper part of the head or crown
bone, form those ienetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily
mentionedb Ihe edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres,
through which the  ight uhale strains the water, and in whose
intricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes through
the seas of brit in feeding timeb bn the central blinds of bone, as they
stand in their natural order, there are certain curious marks, curves,
hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the creature s age,
as the age of an oak by its circular ringsb Ihough the certainty of this
criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical
probabilityb rt any rate, if we yield to it, we must grant a far greater
age to the  ight uhale than at first glance will seem reasonableb

bn old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
concerning these blindsb ene voyager in 
urchas calls them the wondrous
 whiskers  inside of the whale s mouth i another,  hogs  bristles   a
third old gentleman in  ackluyt uses the following elegant languageI
 Ihere are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his
upper s e
, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouthb 


iIhis reminds us that the  ight uhale really has a sort of whisker, or
rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the
upper part of the outer end of the lower eawb oometimes these
tufts impart a rather brigandish espression to his otherwise solemn
countenanceb


rs every one knows, these same  hogs  bristles,   fins,   whiskers, 
 blinds,  or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and
other stiffening contrivancesb  ut in this particular, the demand has
long been on the declineb bt was in eueen rnne s time that the bone was
in its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashionb rnd as those
ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the eaws of the whale, as
you may say  even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we
nowadays fly under the same eaws for protection  the umbrella being a
tent spread over the same boneb

 ut now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and, standing
in the  ight uhale s mouth, look around you afreshb oeeing all these
colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not think
you were inside of the great  aarlem organ, and gacing upon its
thousand pipesn ror a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest
IurkeyIIthe tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the
mouthb bt is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting
it on deckb Ihis particular tongue now before us  at a passing glance b
should say it was a sisIbarreler  that is, it will yield you about that
amount of oilb

sre this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what b started
withIIthat the operm uhale and the  ight uhale have almost entirely
different headsb Io sum up, thenI in the  ight uhale s there is no great
well of sperm  no ivory teeth at all  no long, slender mandible of a
lower eaw, like the operm uhale sb sor in the operm uhale are there any
of those blinds of bone  no huge lower lip  and scarcely anything of a
tongueb rgain, the  ight uhale has two esternal spoutIholes, the operm
uhale only oneb

rook your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie
together  for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea  the other will
not be very long in followingb

san you catch the espression of the operm uhale s theren bt is the same

now faded awayb b think his broad brow to be full of a prairieIlike
placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to deathb  ut mark the
other head s espressionb oee that amacing lower lip, pressed by accident
against the vessel s side, so as firmly to embrace the eawb roes not
this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in
facing deathn Ihis  ight uhale b take to have been a otoic  the operm
uhale, a 
latonian, who might have taken up opinoca in his latter yearsb

Is  dib Ihe  atteringI amb


sre buitting, for the nonce, the operm uhale s head, b would have
you, as a sensible physiologist, simplyIIparticularly remark its front
aspect, in all its compacted collectednessb b would have you investigate
it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unesaggerated,
intelligent estimate of whatever batteringIram power may be lodged
thereb  ere is a vital point  for you must either satisfactorily settle
this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an infidel as to one of
the most appalling, but not the less true events, perhaps anywhere to be
found in all recorded historyb

eou observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the operm uhale,
the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the
water  you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably
backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which
receives the boomIlike lower eaw  you observe that the mouth is entirely
under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as though your own mouth
were entirely under your chinb  oreover you observe that the whale has
no esternal nose  and that what nose he hasIIhis spout holeIIis on the
top of his head  you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides
of his head, nearly one third of his entire length from the frontb
uherefore, you must now have perceived that the front of the operm
uhale s head is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender
prominence of any sort whatsoeverb rurthermore, you are now to consider
that only in the estreme, lower, backward sloping part of the front of
the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone  and not till you
get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial
developmentb oo that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wadb
rinally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents partly comprise
the most delicate oil  yet, you are now to be apprised of the nature of
the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacyb
bn some previous place b have described to you how the blubber wraps the
body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orangeb iust so with the head 
but with this differenceI about the head this envelope, though not so
thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who has not
handled itb Ihe severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by
the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds from itb bt is as though
the forehead of the operm uhale were paved with horses  hoofsb b do not
think that any sensation lurks in itb

 ethink yourself also of another thingb uhen two large, loaded bndiamen
chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the
sailors don Ihey do not suspend between them, at the point of coming
contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or woodb so, they hold
there a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest
and toughest of osIhideb Ihat bravely and unineured takes the eam which
would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crowIbarsb  y
itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact b drive atb  ut
supplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that
as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them,
capable, at will, of distension or contraction  and as the operm uhale,
as far as b know, has no such provision in him  considering, too,
the otherwise inesplicable manner in which he now depresses his head
altogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated out
of the water  considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope 
considering the unibue interior of his head  it has hypothetically
occurred to me, b say, that those mystical lungIcelled honeycombs there
may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connesion with
the outer air, so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and
contractionb bf this be so, fancy the irresistibleness of that might, to
which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributesb

sow, markb bnerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, unineurable
wall, and this most buoyant thing within  there swims behind it all a
mass of tremendous life, only to be adebuately estimated as piled wood

insectb oo that when b shall hereafter detail to you all the
specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this
espansive monster  when b shall show you some of his more inconsiderable
braining feats  b trust you will have renounced all ignorant
incredulity, and be ready to abide by this  that though the operm uhale
stove a passage through the bsthmus of rarien, and mised the rtlantic
with the 
acific, you would not elevate one hair of your eyeIbrowb ror
unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and sentimentalist

encounter  how small the chances for the provincials thenn uhat befell

s r
Is  ddb Ihe  reat  eidelburgh Iunb


sow comes the  aling of the saseb  ut to comprehend it aright, you must
know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated
uponb

 egarding the operm uhale s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an
inclined plane, sideways divide it into two buoins,i whereof the lower
is the bony structure, forming the cranium and eaws, and the upper an
unctuous mass wholly free from bones  its broad forward end forming the
espanded vertical apparent forehead of the whaleb rt the middle of the
forehead horicontally subdivide this upper buoin, and then you have two
almost ebual parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal
wall of a thick tendinous substanceb


ieuoin is not a suclidean termb bt belongs to the pure nautical
mathematicsb b know not that it has been defined beforeb r buoin is a
solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the
steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both
sidesb


Ihe lower subdivided part, called the eunk, is one immense honeycomb
of oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand
infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole
estentb Ihe upper part, known as the sase, may be regarded as the great
 eidelburgh Iun of the operm uhaleb rnd as that famous great tierce is
mystically carved in front, so the whale s vast plaited forehead forms
innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his
wondrous tunb  oreover, as that of  eidelburgh was always replenished
with the most escellent of the wines of the  henish valleys, so the tun
of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages 
namely, the highlyIpriced spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid,
and odoriferous stateb sor is this precious substance found unalloyed
in any other part of the creatureb Ihough in life it remains perfectly
fluid, yet, upon esposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to
concrete  sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the
first thin delicate ice is eust forming in waterb r large whale s
case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from
unavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and
dribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business
of securing what you canb

b know not with what fine and costly material the  eidelburgh Iun
was coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not
possibly have compared with the silken pearlIcoloured membrane, like the
lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the operm uhale s
caseb

bt will have been seen that the  eidelburgh Iun of the operm uhale
embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head  and sinceIIas
has been elsewhere set forthIIthe head embraces one third of the whole
length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet for
a good siced whale, you have more than twentyIsis feet for the depth
of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship s
sideb

rs in decapitating the whale, the operator s instrument is brought close
to the spot where an entrance is subsebuently forced into the spermaceti
magacine  he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless,
untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its
invaluable contentsb bt is this decapitated end of the head, also, which
is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in that position by
the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen combinations, on one side,
make buite a wilderness of ropes in that buarterb

Ihus much being said, attend now, b pray you, to that marvellous andIIin
this particular instanceIIalmost fatal operation whereby the operm
uhale s great  eidelburgh Iun is tappedb

Is  d b sistern and  ucketsb


simble as a cat, Iashtego mounts aloft  and without altering his erect
posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyardIarm, to the
part where it esactly proeects over the hoisted Iunb  e has carried
with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,
travelling through a singleIsheaved blockb oecuring this block, so that
it hangs down from the yardIarm, he swings one end of the rope, till it
is caught and firmly held by a hand on deckb Ihen, handIoverIhand, down
the other part, the bndian drops through the air, till desterously he
lands on the summit of the headb IhereIIstill high elevated above the
rest of the company, to whom he vivaciously criesIIhe seems some Iurkish
 ueccin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a towerb r
shortIhandled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches
for the proper place to begin breaking into the Iunb bn this business
he proceeds very heedfully, like a treasureIhunter in some old house,
sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned inb  y the time
this cautious search is over, a stout ironIbound bucket, precisely like
a wellIbucket, has been attached to one end of the whip  while the other
end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or three
alert handsb Ihese last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the bndian,
to whom another person has reached up a very long poleb bnserting this
pole into the bucket, Iashtego downward guides the bucket into the Iun,
till it entirely disappears  then giving the word to the seamen at the
whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like a dairyImaid s pail
of new milkb sarefully lowered from its height, the fullIfreighted
vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and buickly emptied into a large
tubb Ihen remounting aloft, it again goes through the same round until
the deep cistern will yield no moreb Iowards the end, Iashtego has to
ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Iun,
until some twenty feet of the pole have gone downb

sow, the people of the 
ebuod had been baling some time in this way 
several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm  when all at once a
bueer accident happenedb uhether it was that Iashtego, that wild bndian,
was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his oneIhanded
hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head  or whether the
place where he stood was so treacherous and oocy  or whether the svil
ene himself would have it to fall out so, without stating his particular
reasons  how it was esactly, there is no telling now  but, on a sudden,
as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly upIImy  ods poor
IashtegoIIlike the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well,
dropped headIforemost down into this great Iun of  eidelburgh, and with
a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sights

  an overboards  cried raggoo, who amid the general consternation first
came to his sensesb  owing the bucket this ways  and putting one foot
into it, so as the better to secure his slippery handIhold on the whip
itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost
before Iashtego could have reached its interior bottomb  eantime,
there was a terrible tumultb rooking over the side, they saw the before
lifeless head throbbing and heaving eust below the surface of the sea,
as if that moment seiced with some momentous idea  whereas it was only
the poor bndian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous
depth to which he had sunkb

rt this instant, while raggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing
the whipIIwhich had somehow got foul of the great cutting tacklesIIa
sharp cracking noise was heard  and to the unspeakable horror of all,
one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with
a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship
reeled and shook as if smitten by an icebergb Ihe one remaining hook,
upon which the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be
on the point of giving way  an event still more likely from the violent
motions of the headb

 some down, come downs  yelled the seamen to raggoo, but with one hand
holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he
would still remain suspended  the negro having cleared the foul line,
rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the
buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted outb

 bn heaven s name, man,  cried otubb,  are you ramming home a cartridge
therenIIrvasts  ow will that help him  eamming that ironIbound bucket on
top of his headn rvast, will yes 

 otand clear of the tackles  cried a voice like the bursting of a
rocketb

rlmost in the same instant, with a thunderIboom, the enormous mass
dropped into the sea, like siagara s IableI ock into the whirlpool  the
suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering
copper  and all caught their breath, as half swingingIInow over the
sailors  heads, and now over the waterIIraggoo, through a thick mist of
spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,
buriedIalive Iashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the seas
 ut hardly had the blinding vapour cleared away, when a naked figure
with a boardingIsword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen
hovering over the bulwarksb Ihe nest, a loud splash announced that my
brave eueebueg had dived to the rescueb ene packed rush was made to the
side, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment, and
no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seenb oome hands now
eumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the shipb

  as has  cried raggoo, all at once, from his now buiet, swinging perch
overhead  and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust
upright from the blue waves  a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust
forth from the grass over a graveb

  oths bothsIIit is boths IIcried raggoo again with a eoyful shout  and
soon after, eueebueg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and
with the other clutching the long hair of the bndianb rrawn into the
waiting boat, they were buickly brought to the deck  but Iashtego was
long in coming to, and eueebueg did not look very briskb

sow, how had this noble rescue been accomplishedn uhy, diving after
the slowly descending head, eueebueg with his keen sword had made
side lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there  then
dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,
and so hauled out poor Iash by the headb  e averred, that upon first
thrusting in for him, a leg was presented  but well knowing that that
was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble IIhe had
thrust back the leg, and by a desterous heave and toss, had wrought a
somerset upon the bndian  so that with the nest trial, he came forth in
the good old wayIIhead foremostb rs for the great head itself, that was
doing as well as could be espectedb

rnd thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of eueebueg,
the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Iashtego, was successfully
accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently
hopeless impediments  which is a lesson by no means to be forgottenb
 idwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and bosing,
riding and rowingb

b know that this bueer adventure of the  ayI eader s will be sure to
seem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have either
seen or heard of some one s falling into a cistern ashore  an accident
which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than the
bndian s, considering the esceeding slipperiness of the curb of the
operm uhale s wellb

 ut, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is thisn ue thought
the tissued, infiltrated head of the operm uhale, was the lightest and
most corky part about him  and yet thou makest it sink in an element of
a far greater specific gravity than itselfb ue have thee thereb sot at
all, but b have ye  for at the time poor Iash fell in, the case had been
nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the dense
tendinous wall of the wellIIa double welded, hammered substance, as b
have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of which
sinks in it like lead almostb  ut the tendency to rapid sinking in this
substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the
other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it sank
very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording eueebueg a fair chance
for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may sayb ees, it

Io scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this
reviathan  this is a thing which no 
hysiognomist or 
hrenologist has as
yet undertakenb ouch an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for
ravater to have scrutiniced the wrinkles on the  ock of  ibraltar,
or for  all to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the rome of the

antheonb otill, in that famous work of his, ravater not only treats
of the various faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces
of horses, birds, serpents, and fish  and dwells in detail upon the
modifications of espression discernible thereinb sor have  all and
his disciple opurcheim failed to throw out some hints touching the
phrenological characteristics of other beings than manb Iherefore,
though b am but ill bualified for a pioneer, in the application of these
two semiIsciences to the whale, b will do my endeavorb b try all things 
b achieve what b canb


hysiognomically regarded, the operm uhale is an anomalous creatureb
 e has no proper noseb rnd since the nose is the central and most
conspicuous of the features  and since it perhaps most modifies and
finally controls their combined espression  hence it would seem that its
entire absence, as an esternal appendage, must very largely affect
the countenance of the whaleb ror as in landscape gardening, a spire,
cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable
to the completion of the scene  so no face can be physiognomically in
keeping without the elevated openIwork belfry of the noseb rash the nose
from 
hidias s marble iove, and what a sorry remainders severtheless,
reviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his proportions are so
stately, that the same deficiency which in the sculptured iove were
hideous, in him is no blemish at allb say, it is an added grandeurb r
nose to the whale would have been impertinentb rs on your physiognomical
voyage you sail round his vast head in your eollyIboat, your noble
conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a
nose to be pulledb r pestilent conceit, which so often will insist upon
obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throneb

bn some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to
be had of the operm uhale, is that of the full front of his headb Ihis
aspect is sublimeb

bn thought, a fine human brow is like the sast when troubled with the
morningb bn the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has a
touch of the grand in itb 
ushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles, the
elephant s brow is maeesticb  uman or animal, the mystical brow is as
that great golden seal affised by the  erman smperors to their decreesb
bt signifiesII  odI done this day by my handb   ut in most creatures,
nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine
land lying along the snow lineb rew are the foreheads which like
ohakespeare s or  elancthon s rise so high, and descend so low, that the
eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes  and all
above them in the forehead s wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered
thoughts descending there to drink, as the  ighland hunters track the
snow prints of the deerb  ut in the great operm uhale, this high and
mighty godIlike dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified,
that gacing on it, in that full front view, you feel the reity and the
dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other obeect in living
natureb ror you see no one point precisely  not one distinct feature is
revealed  no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth  no face  he has none, proper 
nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead, pleated with
riddles  dumbly lowering with the doom of boats, and ships, and menb
sor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish  though that way
viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you sob bn profile, you
plainly perceive that horicontal, semiIcrescentic depression in the
forehead s middle, which, in man, is ravater s mark of geniusb

 ut hown  enius in the operm uhalen  as the operm uhale ever written
a book, spoken a speechn so, his great genius is declared in his
doing nothing particular to prove itb bt is moreover declared in his
pyramidical silenceb rnd this reminds me that had the great operm uhale
been known to the young erient uorld, he would have been deified by
their childImagian thoughtsb Ihey deified the crocodile of the sile,
because the crocodile is tongueless  and the operm uhale has no
tongue, or at least it is so esceedingly small, as to be incapable of
protrusionb bf hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure
back to their birthIright, the merry  ayIday gods of old  and livingly
enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky  in the now unhaunted
hill  then be sure, esalted to iove s high seat, the great operm uhale
shall lord itb

shampollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphicsb  ut there is
no shampollion to decipher the sgypt of every man s and every being s
faceb 
hysiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing
fableb bf then, oir uilliam iones, who read in thirty languages, could
not read the simplest peasant s face in its profounder and more subtle
meanings, how may unlettered bshmael hope to read the awful shaldee of
the operm uhale s brown b but put that brow before youb  ead it if you
canb



s r
Is   nb Ihe sutb


bf the operm uhale be physiognomically a ophins, to the phrenologist his
brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to sbuareb

bn the fullIgrown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet
in lengthb bnhinge the lower eaw, and the side view of this skull is as
the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level
baseb  ut in lifeIIas we have elsewhere seenIIthis inclined plane is
angularly filled up, and almost sbuared by the enormous superincumbent
mass of the eunk and spermb rt the high end the skull forms a crater to
bed that part of the mass  while under the long floor of this craterIIin
another cavity seldom esceeding ten inches in length and as many in
depthIIreposes the mere handful of this monster s brainb Ihe brain is at
least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life  it is hidden
away behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the
amplified fortifications of euebecb oo like a choice casket is it
secreted in him, that b have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny
that the operm uhale has any other brain than that palpable semblance
of one formed by the cubicIyards of his sperm magacineb rying in strange
folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it seems more
in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part
of him as the seat of his intelligenceb

bt is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this reviathan, in
the creature s living intact state, is an entire delusionb rs for his
true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel anyb Ihe
whale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the common
worldb

bf you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view
of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its
resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from
the same point of viewb bndeed, place this reversed skull iscaled down
to the human magnitudei among a plate of men s skulls, and you would
involuntarily confound it with them  and remarking the depressions on
one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would sayIIIhis
man had no selfIesteem, and no venerationb rnd by those negations,
considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and
power, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most
eshilarating conception of what the most esalted potency isb

 ut if from the comparative dimensions of the whale s proper brain, you
deem it incapable of being adebuately charted, then b have another idea
for youb bf you attentively regard almost any buadruped s spine,
you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung
necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the
skull properb bt is a  erman conceit, that the vertebrae are absolutely
undeveloped skullsb  ut the curious esternal resemblance, b take it
the  ermans were not the first men to perceiveb r foreign friend once
pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with
the vertebrae of which he was inlaying, in a sort of bassoIrelievo, the
beaked prow of his canoeb sow, b consider that the phrenologists have
omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the
cerebellum through the spinal canalb ror b believe that much of a man s
character will be found betokened in his backboneb b would rather feel
your spine than your skull, whoever you areb r thin eoist of a spine
never yet upheld a full and noble soulb b reeoice in my spine, as in the
firm audacious staff of that flag which b fling half out to the worldb

rpply this spinal branch of phrenology to the operm uhaleb  is cranial
cavity is continuous with the first neckIvertebra  and in that vertebra
the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being
eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwardsb rs
it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in sice, but
for a considerable distance remains of large capacityb sow, of course,
this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substanceIIthe
spinal cordIIas the brain  and directly communicates with the brainb
rnd what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain s
cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost
ebual to that of the brainb bnder all these circumstances, would it be
unreasonable to survey and map out the whale s spine phrenologicallyn
ror, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his
brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative
magnitude of his spinal cordb

 ut leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, b
would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the
operm uhale s humpb Ihis august hump, if b mistake not, rises over one
of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer
conves mould of itb rrom its relative situation then, b should call this
high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the operm uhaleb
rnd that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have reason to
knowb

Is    b Ihe 
ebuod  eets Ihe iirginb


Ihe predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship iungfrau, rerick
re reer, master, of  remenb

rt one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the rutch and
 ermans are now among the least  but here and there at very wide
intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with
their flag in the 
acificb

ror some reason, the iungfrau seemed buite eager to pay her respectsb
uhile yet some distance from the 
ebuod, she rounded to, and dropping a
boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the
bows instead of the sternb

 uhat has he in his hand theren  cried otarbuck, pointing to something
wavingly held by the  ermanb  bmpossiblesIIa lampIfeeders 

 sot that,  said otubb,  no, no, it s a coffeeIpot,  rb otarbuck  he s
coming off to make us our coffee, is the earman  don t you see that big
tin can there alongside of himnIIthat s his boiling waterb ehs he s all
right, is the earmanb 

  o along with you,  cried rlask,  it s a lampIfeeder and an oilIcanb
 e s out of oil, and has come aIbeggingb 

 owever curious it may seem for an oilIship to be borrowing oil on the
whaleIground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old
proverb about carrying coals to sewcastle, yet sometimes such a thing
really happens  and in the present case saptain rerick re reer did
indubitably conduct a lampIfeeder as rlask did declareb

rs he mounted the deck, rhab abruptly accosted him, without at all
heeding what he had in his hand  but in his broken lingo, the  erman
soon evinced his complete ignorance of the uhite uhale  immediately
turning the conversation to his lampIfeeder and oil can, with some
remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in
profound darknessIIhis last drop of  remen oil being gone, and not a
single flyingIfish yet captured to supply the deficiency  concluding
by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the rishery is technically
called a srsrs one ithat is, an empty onei, well deserving the name of
iungfrau or the iirginb

 is necessities supplied, rerick departed  but he had not gained his
ship s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the
mastIheads of both vessels  and so eager for the chase was rerick, that
without pausing to put his oilIcan and lampIfeeder aboard, he slewed
round his boat and made after the leviathan lampIfeedersb

sow, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three  erman
boats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the 
ebuod s
keelsb Ihere were eight whales, an average podb rware of their danger,
they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind,
rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harnessb
Ihey left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling a great
wide parchment upon the seab

rull in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,
humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as
by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted
with the eaundice, or some other infirmityb uhether this whale belonged
to the pod in advance, seemed buestionable  for it is not customary for
such venerable leviathans to be at all socialb severtheless, he stuck
to their wake, though indeed their back water must have retarded him,
because the whiteIbone or swell at his broad muccle was a dashed one,
like the swell formed when two hostile currents meetb  is spout was
short, slow, and laborious  coming forth with a choking sort of gush,
and spending itself in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean
commotions in him, which seemed to have egress at his other buried
estremity, causing the waters behind him to upbubbleb

 uho s got some paregoricn  said otubb,  he has the stomachIache, b m
afraidb rord, think of having half an acre of stomachIaches rdverse
winds are holding mad shristmas in him, boysb bt s the first foul wind
b ever knew to blow from astern  but look, did ever whale yaw so beforen
it must be, he s lost his tillerb 

rs an overladen bndiaman bearing down the  indostan coast with a deck
load of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her
way  so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly
turning over on his cumbrous ribIends, espose the cause of his devious
wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard finb uhether he had lost
that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to sayb

 enly wait a bit, old chap, and b ll give ye a sling for that wounded
arm,  cried cruel rlask, pointing to the whaleIline near himb

  ind he don t sling thee with it,  cried otarbuckb   ive way, or the
 erman will have himb 

uith one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this
one fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most
valuable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were
going with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit
for the timeb rt this euncture the 
ebuod s keels had shot by the three
 erman boats last lowered  but from the great start he had had, rerick s
boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his foreign
rivalsb Ihe only thing they feared, was, that from being already so
nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron before they
could completely overtake and pass himb rs for rerick, he seemed buite
confident that this would be the case, and occasionally with a deriding
gesture shook his lampIfeeder at the other boatsb

rt this moment rerick was in the act of pitching his lampIfeeder at the
advancing boats, and also his oilIcan  perhaps with the double view
of retarding his rivals  way, and at the same time economically
accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward tossb

 Ihe unmannerly rutch doggers  cried otubbb

 b say, pull like godIdam, IIcried the bndianb

riercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the  erman, the 
ebuod s
three boats now began ranging almost abreast  and, so disposed,
momentarily neared himb bn that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of
the headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up
proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an eshilarating cry
of,  Ihere she slides, nows  urrah for the whiteIash breeces rown with
the earmans oail over hims 

 ut so decided an original start had rerick had, that spite of all
their gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not
a righteous eudgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade
of his midship oarsmanb uhile this clumsy lubber was striving to free
his whiteIash, and while, in consebuence, rerick s boat was nigh to
capsicing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage IIthat was
a good time for otarbuck, otubb, and rlaskb uith a shout, they took a
mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the  erman s buarterb
rn instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the whale s
immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was the
foaming swell that he madeb

bt was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sightb Ihe whale was
now going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual
tormented eet  while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of
frightb sow to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering flight,
and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank in the
sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating finb oo have b
seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the
air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawksb  ut the bird has a
voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear  but the fear
of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in him 
he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his spiracle,
and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable  while still, in his
amacing bulk, portcullis eaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to
appal the stoutest man who so pitiedb

oeeing now that but a very few moments more would give the 
ebuod s
boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, rerick
chose to hacard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart,
ere the last chance would for ever escapeb

 ut no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three
tigersIIeueebueg, Iashtego, raggooIIinstinctively sprang to their feet,
and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their barbs  and
darted over the head of the  erman harpooneer, their three santucket
irons entered the whaleb  linding vapours of foam and whiteIfires Ihe
three boats, in the first fury of the whale s headlong rush, bumped
the  erman s aside with such force, that both rerick and his baffled
harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three flying keelsb

 ron t be afraid, my butterIboses,  cried otubb, casting a passing
glance upon them as he shot by   ye ll be picked up presentlyIIall

carries the everlasting mails 

 ut the monster s run was a brief oneb  iving a sudden gasp, he
tumultuously soundedb uith a grating rush, the three lines flew round
the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them 
while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would
soon eshaust the lines, that using all their desterous might, they
caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on  till at
lastIIowing to the perpendicular strain from the leadIlined chocks of
the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blueIIthe
gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three
sterns tilted high in the airb rnd the whale soon ceasing to sound,
for some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of espending more
line, though the position was a little ticklishb  ut though boats have
been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this  holding on,  as it
is called  this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from
the back  this it is that often torments the reviathan into soon rising
again to meet the sharp lance of his foesb eet not to speak of the peril
of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always the
best  for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken
whale stays under water, the more he is eshaustedb  ecause, owing to the
enormous surface of himIIin a full grown sperm whale something less than
dnnn sbuare feetIIthe pressure of the water is immenseb ue all know
what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under  even
here, aboveIground, in the air  how vast, then, the burden of a whale,
bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of oceans bt must at
least ebual the weight of fifty atmospheresb ene whaleman has estimated
it at the weight of twenty lineIofIbattle ships, with all their guns,
and stores, and men on boardb

rs the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gacing down
into its eternal blue noon  and as not a single groan or cry of any
sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths 
what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that silence and
placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in
agonys sot eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bowsb
oeems it credible that by three such thin threads the great reviathan
was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clockb ouspendedn and
to whatn Io three bits of boardb bs this the creature of whom it was
once so triumphantly saidII sanst thou fill his skin with barbed ironsn
or his head with fishIspearsn Ihe sword of him that layeth at him cannot

that unfulfilments should follow the prophetsb ror with the strength
of a thousand thighs in his tail, reviathan had run his head under the
mountains of the sea, to hide him from the 
ebuod s fishIspearss

bn that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats
sent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad
enough to shade half aerses  armyb uho can tell how appalling to the
wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his heads

 otand by, men  he stirs,  cried otarbuck, as the three lines suddenly
vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by
magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every
oarsman felt them in his seatb Ihe nest moment, relieved in great part
from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce
upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are
scared from it into the seab

  aul ins  aul ins  cried otarbuck again   he s risingb 

Ihe lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand s breadth
could have been gained, were now in long buick coils flung back all
dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two
ship s lengths of the huntersb

 is motions plainly denoted his estreme eshaustionb bn most land animals
there are certain valves or floodIgates in many of their veins, whereby
when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in
certain directionsb sot so with the whale  one of whose peculiarities
it is to have an entire nonIvalvular structure of the bloodIvessels, so
that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly
drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system  and when this is
heightened by the estraordinary pressure of water at a great distance
below the surface, his life may be said to pour from him in incessant
streamsb eet so vast is the buantity of blood in him, and so distant
and numerous its interior fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and
bleeding for a considerable period  even as in a drought a river will
flow, whose source is in the wellIsprings of farIoff and undiscernible
hillsb sven now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously
drew over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him,
they were followed by steady eets from the new made wound, which kept
continually playing, while the natural spoutIhole in his head was only
at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture into the
airb rrom this last vent no blood yet came, because no vital part of him
had thus far been struckb  is life, as they significantly call it, was
untouchedb

rs the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of
his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly
revealedb  is eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were
beheldb rs strange misgrown masses gather in the knotIholes of the
noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale s eyes
had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to seeb
 ut pity there was noneb ror all his old age, and his one arm, and his
blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light the
gay bridals and other merryImakings of men, and also to illuminate the
solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to allb
otill rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely
discoloured bunch or protuberance, the sice of a bushel, low down on the
flankb

 rvasts  cried otarbuck,  there s no need of thats 

 ut humane otarbuck was too lateb rt the instant of the dart an
ulcerous eet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than
sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury
blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews
all over with showers of gore, capsicing rlask s boat and marring the
bowsb bt was his death strokeb ror, by this time, so spent was he by
loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had
made  lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,
then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world  turned up

showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifledb bmmediately,
by otarbuck s orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so
that ere long every boat was a buoy  the sunken whale being suspended a
few inches beneath them by the cordsb  y very heedful management, when
the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred to her side, and was
strongly secured there by the stiffest flukeIchains, for it was plain
that unless artificially upheld, the body would at once sink to the
bottomb

bt so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,
the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh,
on the lower part of the bunch before describedb  ut as the stumps of
harpoons are frebuently found in the dead bodies of captured whales,
with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any
kind to denote their place  therefore, there must needs have been
some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for
the ulceration alluded tob  ut still more curious was the fact of a
lanceIhead of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,
the flesh perfectly firm about itb uho had darted that stone lancen rnd
whenn bt might have been darted by some sor  uest bndian long before
rmerica was discoveredb

uhat other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous
cabinet there is no tellingb  ut a sudden stop was put to further
discoveries, by the ship s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways
to the sea, owing to the body s immensely increasing tendency to sinkb
 owever, otarbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the
last  hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship
would have been capsiced, if still persisting in locking arms with the
body  then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such was
the immovable strain upon the timberIheads to which the flukeIchains and
cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them offb  eantime
everything in the 
ebuod was aslantb Io cross to the other side of the
deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a houseb Ihe ship
groaned and gaspedb  any of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and
cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural dislocationb
bn vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable
flukeIchains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads  and so low
had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all
approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to
the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going overb

  old on, hold on, won t yen  cried otubb to the body,  don t be in such
a devil of a hurry to sinks  y thunder, men, we must do something or go
for itb so use prying there  avast, b say with your handspikes, and run
one of ye for a prayer book and a penIknife, and cut the big chainsb 

 nnifen rye, aye,  cried eueebueg, and seicing the carpenter s heavy
hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing
at the largest flukeIchainsb  ut a few strokes, full of sparks, were
given, when the esceeding strain effected the restb uith a terrific
snap, every fastening went adrift  the ship righted, the carcase sankb

sow, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed operm
uhale is a very curious thing  nor has any fisherman yet adebuately
accounted for itb bsually the dead operm uhale floats with great
buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the
surfaceb bf the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and
brokenIhearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their
bones heavy and rheumatic  then you might with some reason assert that
this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so
sinking, consebuent upon this absence of buoyant matter in himb  ut it
is not sob ror young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with
noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and  ay of
life, with all their panting lard about them  even these brawny, buoyant
heroes do sometimes sinkb

 e it said, however, that the operm uhale is far less liable to this
accident than any other speciesb uhere one of that sort go down, twenty
 ight uhales dob Ihis difference in the species is no doubt imputable in
no small degree to the greater buantity of bone in the  ight uhale 
his ienetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton  from this
incumbrance the operm uhale is wholly freeb  ut there are instances
where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale
again rises, more buoyant than in lifeb  ut the reason of this
is obviousb  ases are generated in him  he swells to a prodigious
magnitude  becomes a sort of animal balloonb r lineIofIbattle ship could
hardly keep him under thenb bn the ohore uhaling, on soundings, among
the  ays of sew iealand, when a  ight uhale gives token of sinking, they
fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope  so that when the body has gone
down, they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended againb

bt was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from
the 
ebuod s mastIheads, announcing that the iungfrau was again lowering
her boats  though the only spout in sight was that of a rinI ack,
belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of its
incredible power of swimmingb severtheless, the rinI ack s spout is so
similar to the operm uhale s, that by unskilful fishermen it is often
mistaken for itb rnd consebuently rerick and all his host were now in
valiant chase of this unnearable bruteb Ihe iirgin crowding all sail,
made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared far to
leeward, still in bold, hopeful chaseb

Ihere are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true
methodb

Ihe more b dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up
to the very springIhead of it so much the more am b impressed with its
great honourableness and antibuity  and especially when b find so many
great demiIgods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other
have shed distinction upon it, b am transported with the reflection
that b myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblaconed a
fraternityb

Ihe gallant 
erseus, a son of iupiter, was the first whaleman  and
to the eternal honour of our calling be it said, that the first whale
attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intentb Ihose
were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms to
succor the distressed, and not to fill men s lampIfeedersb svery one
knows the fine story of 
erseus and rndromeda  how the lovely rndromeda,
the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the seaIcoast, and as
reviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, 
erseus, the prince
of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and delivered
and married the maidb bt was an admirable artistic esploit, rarely
achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day  inasmuch as this
reviathan was slain at the very first dartb rnd let no man doubt this
rrkite story  for in the ancient ioppa, now iaffa, on the oyrian coast,
in one of the 
agan temples, there stood for many ages the vast skeleton
of a whale, which the city s legends and all the inhabitants asserted to
be the identical bones of the monster that 
erseus slewb uhen the  omans
took ioppa, the same skeleton was carried to btaly in triumphb uhat
seems most singular and suggestively important in this story, is thisI
it was from ioppa that ionah set sailb

rkin to the adventure of 
erseus and rndromedaIIindeed, by some supposed
to be indirectly derived from itIIis that famous story of otb  eorge and
the rragon  which dragon b maintain to have been a whale  for in many
old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely eumbled together, and
often stand for each otherb  Ihou art as a lion of the waters, and as a
dragon of the sea,  saith scekiel  hereby, plainly meaning a whale 
in truth, some versions of the  ible use that word itselfb  esides, it
would much subtract from the glory of the esploit had otb  eorge but
encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle
with the great monster of the deepb rny man may kill a snake, but only a

erseus, a otb  eorge, a soffin, have the heart in them to march boldly
up to a whaleb

ret not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us  for though
the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely
represented of a griffinIlike shape, and though the battle is depicted
on land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance
of those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists 
and considering that as in 
erseus  case, otb  eorge s whale might have
crawled up out of the sea on the beach  and considering that the animal
ridden by otb  eorge might have been only a large seal, or seaIhorse 
bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible
with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to
hold this soIcalled dragon no other than the great reviathan himselfb bn
fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story will
fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the 
hilistines, ragon by
name  who being planted before the ark of bsrael, his horse s head and
both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or
fishy part of him remainedb Ihus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even
a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of sngland  and by good rights, we
harpooneers of santucket should be enrolled in the most noble order
of otb  eorgeb rnd therefore, let not the knights of that honourable
company inone of whom, b venture to say, have ever had to do with a
whale like their great patroni, let them never eye a santucketer with
disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are
much better entitled to otb  eorge s decoration than theyb

uhether to admit  ercules among us or not, concerning this b long
remained dubiousI for though according to the  reek mythologies, that
antibue srockett and nit sarsonIIthat brawny doer of reeoicing good
deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale  still, whether
that strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mootedb bt nowhere
appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed,
from the insideb severtheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary
whaleman  at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whaleb b
claim him for one of our clanb

 ut, by the best contradictory authorities, this  recian story of
 ercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more
ancient  ebrew story of ionah and the whale  and vice versa  certainly
they are very similarb bf b claim the demigod then, why not the prophetn

sor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole
roll of our orderb eur grand master is still to be named  for like royal
kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing
short of the great gods themselvesb Ihat wondrous oriental story is now
to be rehearsed from the ohaster, which gives us the dread iishnoo, one
of the three persons in the godhead of the  indoos  gives us this divine
iishnoo himself for our rord IIiishnoo, who, by the first of his ten
earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified the whaleb
uhen  rahma, or the  od of  ods, saith the ohaster, resolved to recreate
the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to
iishnoo, to preside over the work  but the iedas, or mystical books,
whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to iishnoo before
beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained
something in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these
iedas were lying at the bottom of the waters  so iishnoo became
incarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths,
rescued the sacred volumesb uas not this iishnoo a whaleman, thenn even

s r
Is    b ionah  istorically  egardedb


 eference was made to the historical story of ionah and the whale in the
preceding chapterb sow some santucketers rather distrust this historical
story of ionah and the whaleb  ut then there were some sceptical  reeks
and  omans, who, standing out from the orthodos pagans of their times,
ebually doubted the story of  ercules and the whale, and rrion and the
dolphin  and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those
traditions one whit the less facts, for all thatb

ene old oagI arbor whaleman s chief reason for buestioning the  ebrew
story was thisIII e had one of those buaint oldIfashioned  ibles,
embellished with curious, unscientific plates  one of which represented
ionah s whale with two spouts in his headIIa peculiarity only true
with respect to a species of the reviathan ithe  ight uhale, and the
varieties of that orderi, concerning which the fishermen have this
saying,  r penny roll would choke him   his swallow is so very smallb
 ut, to this,  ishop iebb s anticipative answer is readyb bt is not
necessary, hints the  ishop, that we consider ionah as tombed in the
whale s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouthb rnd
this seems reasonable enough in the good  ishopb ror truly, the
 ight uhale s mouth would accommodate a couple of whistItables, and
comfortably seat all the playersb 
ossibly, too, ionah might have
ensconced himself in a hollow tooth  but, on second thoughts, the  ight
uhale is toothlessb

rnother reason which oagI arbor ihe went by that namei urged for his
want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in
reference to his incarcerated body and the whale s gastric euicesb  ut
this obeection likewise falls to the ground, because a  erman esegetist
supposes that ionah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a
rsrr whaleIIeven as the rrench soldiers in the  ussian campaign turned
their dead horses into tents, and crawled into themb  esides, it has
been divined by other continental commentators, that when ionah was
thrown overboard from the ioppa ship, he straightway effected his escape
to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figureIhead 
and, b would add, possibly called  Ihe uhale,  as some craft are
nowadays christened the  ohark,  the   ull,  the  sagleb  sor have there
been wanting learned esegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned
in the book of ionah merely meant a lifeIpreserverIIan inflated bag
of windIIwhich the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a
watery doomb 
oor oagI arbor, therefore, seems worsted all roundb  ut
he had still another reason for his want of faithb bt was this, if b
remember rightI ionah was swallowed by the whale in the  editerranean
oea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days 
eourney of sineveh, a city on the Iigris, very much more than three
days  eourney across from the nearest point of the  editerranean coastb
 ow is thatn

 ut was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that
short distance of sinevehn eesb  e might have carried him round by the
way of the sape of  ood  opeb  ut not to speak of the passage through
the whole length of the  editerranean, and another passage up the

ersian  ulf and  ed oea, such a supposition would involve the complete
circumnavigation of all rfrica in three days, not to speak of the Iigris
waters, near the site of sineveh, being too shallow for any whale to
swim inb  esides, this idea of ionah s weathering the sape of  ood  ope
at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great
headland from  artholomew riac, its reputed discoverer, and so make
modern history a liarb

 ut all these foolish arguments of old oagI arbor only evinced his
foolish pride of reasonIIa thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing
that he had but little learning escept what he had picked up from the
sun and the seab b say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and
abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergyb ror by a

ortuguese satholic priest, this very idea of ionah s going to sineveh
via the sape of  ood  ope was advanced as a signal magnification of
the general miracleb rnd so it wasb  esides, to this day, the highly
enlightened Iurks devoutly believe in the historical story of ionahb rnd
some three centuries ago, an snglish traveller in old  arris s ioyages,
speaks of a Iurkish  osbue built in honour of ionah, in which  osbue was
a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oilb

Is    b 
itchpolingb


Io make them run easily and swiftly, the asles of carriages are
anointed  and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an
analogous operation upon their boat  they grease the bottomb sor is it
to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly
be of no contemptible advantage  considering that oil and water are
hostile  that oil is a sliding thing, and that the obeect in view is to
make the boat slide bravelyb eueebueg believed strongly in anointing
his boat, and one morning not long after the  erman ship iungfrau
disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation  crawling
under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in the
unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from
the craft s bald keelb  e seemed to be working in obedience to some
particular presentimentb sor did it remain unwarranted by the eventb

Iowards noon whales were raised  but so soon as the ship sailed down to
them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy  a disordered flight,
as of sleopatra s barges from rctiumb

severtheless, the boats pursued, and otubb s was foremostb  y great
esertion, Iashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron  but the
stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horicontal
flight, with added fleetnessb ouch unintermitted strainings upon the
planted iron must sooner or later inevitably estract itb bt became
imperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose himb  ut
to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and
furiousb uhat then remainedn

ef all the wondrous devices and desterities, the sleights of hand and
countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,
none esceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpolingb omall
sword, or broad sword, in all its esercises boasts nothing like itb bt
is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale  its grand
fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is
accurately darted from a violently rocking, eerking boat, under estreme
headwayb oteel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve
feet in length  the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon,
and also of a lighter materialIIpineb bt is furnished with a small rope
called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to
the hand after dartingb

 ut before going further, it is important to mention here, that though
the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it
is seldom done  and when done, is still less frebuently successful,
on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as
compared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacksb rs a
general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before any
pitchpoling comes into playb

rook now at otubb  a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and
ebuanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially bualified to escel
in pitchpolingb rook at him  he stands upright in the tossed bow of the
flying boat  wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet aheadb
 andling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its
length to see if it be esactly straight, otubb whistlingly gathers up
the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in his
grasp, leaving the rest unobstructedb Ihen holding the lance full before
his waistband s middle, he levels it at the whale  when, covering
him with it, he steadily depresses the buttIend in his hand, thereby
elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his
palm, fifteen feet in the airb  e minds you somewhat of a euggler,
balancing a long staff on his chinb sest moment with a rapid, nameless
impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming
distance, and buivers in the life spot of the whaleb bnstead of
sparkling water, he now spouts red bloodb

 Ihat drove the spigot out of hims  cried otubbb   Iis iuly s immortal
rourth  all fountains must run wine todays uould now, it were old
erleans whiskey, or old ehio, or unspeakable old  onongahelas Ihen,
Iashtego, lad, b d have ye hold a canakin to the eet, and we d drink
round its eea, verily, hearts alive, we d brew choice punch in the
spread of his spoutIhole there, and from that live punchIbowl buaff the
living stuffb 

rgain and again to such gamesome talk, the desterous dart is repeated,
the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful
leashb Ihe agoniced whale goes into his flurry  the towIline is
slackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and
mutely watches the monster dieb



s r
Is   db Ihe rountainb


Ihat for sis thousand yearsIIand no one knows how many millions of ages
beforeIIthe great whales should have been spouting all over the sea,
and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so
many sprinkling or mistifying pots  and that for some centuries back,
thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the
whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutingsIIthat all this should
be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute ififteen and a buarter
minutes past one o clock 
b b of this sisteenth day of recember, rbrb
  d i, it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings
are, after all, really water, or nothing but vapourIIthis is surely a
noteworthy thingb

ret us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items
contingentb svery one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their
gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is
combined with the element in which they swim  hence, a herring or a cod
might live a century, and never once raise its head above the surfaceb
 ut owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular
lungs, like a human being s, the whale can only live by inhaling the
disengaged air in the open atmosphereb uherefore the necessity for
his periodical visits to the upper worldb  ut he cannot in any degree
breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude, the operm
uhale s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface  and
what is still more, his windpipe has no connesion with his mouthb so, he
breathes through his spiracle alone  and this is on the top of his headb

bf b say, that in any creature breathing is only a function
indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a
certain element, which being subsebuently brought into contact with the
blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, b do not think b
shall err  though b may possibly use some superfluous scientific wordsb
rssume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be
aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not
fetch another for a considerable timeb Ihat is to say, he would then
live without breathingb rnomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the
case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full
hour and more iwhen at the bottomi without drawing a single breath, or
so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air  for, remember, he has
no gillsb  ow is thisn  etween his ribs and on each side of his spine
he is supplied with a remarkable involved sretan labyrinth of
vermicelliIlike vessels, which vessels, when he buits the surface, are
completely distended with osygenated bloodb oo that for an hour or more,
a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of vitality in
him, eust as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus
supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachsb
Ihe anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable  and that the
supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more
cogent to me, when b consider the otherwise inesplicable obstinacy of
that leviathan in  ribs   bo o
ebIbs o ebI, as the fishermen phrase
itb Ihis is what b meanb bf unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the
operm uhale will continue there for a period of time esactly uniform
with all his other unmolested risingsb oay he stays eleven minutes, and
eets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths  then whenever he
rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to
a minuteb sow, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him, so that
he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular
allowance of airb rnd not till those seventy breaths are told, will he
finally go down to stay out his full term belowb  emark, however, that
in different individuals these rates are different  but in any one
they are alikeb sow, why should the whale thus insist upon having his
spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere
descending for goodn  ow obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the
whale s rising esposes him to all the fatal hacards of the chaseb ror
not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing
a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlightb sot so much thy skill, then, e
hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thees

bn man, breathing is incessantly going onIIone breath only serving
for two or three pulsations  so that whatever other business he has to
attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he willb  ut the
operm uhale only breathes about one seventh or ounday of his timeb

bt has been said that the whale only breathes through his spoutIhole  if
it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mised with water, then
b opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell
seems obliterated in him  for the only thing about him that at all
answers to his nose is that identical spoutIhole  and being so clogged
with two elements, it could not be espected to have the power of
smellingb  ut owing to the mystery of the spoutIIwhether it be water or
whether it be vapourIIno absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on
this headb oure it is, nevertheless, that the operm uhale has no proper
olfactoriesb  ut what does he want of themn so roses, no violets, no
sologneIwater in the seab

rurthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting
canal, and as that long canalIIlike the grand srie sanalIIis furnished
with a sort of locks ithat open and shuti for the downward retention of
air or the upward esclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice 
unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles,
he talks through his noseb  ut then again, what has the whale to sayn
oeldom have b known any profound being that had anything to say to
this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a
livingb ehs happy that the world is such an escellent listeners

sow, the spouting canal of the operm uhale, chiefly intended as it
is for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,
horicontally, eust beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little
to one side  this curious canal is very much like a gasIpipe laid down
in a city on one side of a streetb  ut the buestion returns whether this
gasIpipe is also a waterIpipe  in other words, whether the spout of the
operm uhale is the mere vapour of the eshaled breath, or whether that
eshaled breath is mised with water taken in at the mouth, and
discharged through the spiracleb bt is certain that the mouth indirectly
communicates with the spouting canal  but it cannot be proved that this
is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracleb  ecause
the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be, when in feeding he
accidentally takes in waterb  ut the operm uhale s food is far beneath
the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he wouldb  esides, if
you regard him very closely, and time him with your watch, you will find
that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods
of his eets and the ordinary periods of respirationb

 ut why pester one with all this reasoning on the subeectn opeak outs
eou have seen him spout  then declare what the spout is  can you not
tell water from airn  y dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to
settle these plain thingsb b have ever found your plain things the
knottiest of allb rnd as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in
it, and yet be undecided as to what it is preciselyb

Ihe central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping
it  and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,
when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view
of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading
all around himb rnd if at such times you should think that you really
perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are
not merely condensed from its vapour  or how do you know that they
are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spoutIhole
fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale s headn ror
even when tranbuilly swimming through the midIday sea in a calm, with
his elevated hump sunIdried as a dromedary s in the desert  even then,
the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under
a blacing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with
rainb

sor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the
precise nature of the whale spoutb bt will not do for him to be peering
into it, and putting his face in itb eou cannot go with your pitcher to
this fountain and fill it, and bring it awayb ror even when coming into
slight contact with the outer, vapoury shreds of the eet, which will
often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of
the thing so touching itb rnd b know one, who coming into still closer
contact with the spout, whether with some scientific obeect in view,
or otherwise, b cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and armb
uherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous  they try to

Is   ib Ihe Iailb


ether poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,
and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights  less celestial, b
celebrate a tailb

 eckoning the largest siced operm uhale s tail to begin at that point of
the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises
upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty sbuare feetb Ihe
compact round body of its root espands into two broad, firm, flat palms
or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thicknessb
rt the crotch or eunction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways
recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy betweenb bn
no living thing are the lines of beauty more esbuisitely defined than in
the crescentic borders of these flukesb rt its utmost espansion in the
full grown whale, the tail will considerably esceed twenty feet acrossb

Ihe entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews  but cut
into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose itIIIupper,
middle, and lowerb Ihe fibres in the upper and lower layers, are
long and horicontal  those of the middle one, very short, and running
crosswise between the outside layersb Ihis triune structure, as much as
anything else, imparts power to the tailb Io the student of old  oman
walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin
course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful
relics of the antibue, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the
great strength of the masonryb

 ut as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,
the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of
muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins
and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and
largely contribute to their might  so that in the tail the confluent
measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a pointb
sould annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do itb

sor does thisIIits amacing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful
flesion of its motions  where infantileness of ease undulates through
a Iitanism of powerb en the contrary, those motions derive their most
appalling beauty from itb  eal strength never impairs beauty or harmony,
but it often bestows it  and in everything imposingly beautiful,
strength has much to do with the magicb Iake away the tied tendons that
all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved  ercules, and its
charm would be goneb rs devout sckerman lifted the linen sheet from the
naked corpse of  oethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the
man, that seemed as a  oman triumphal archb uhen rngelo paints even  od
the rather in human form, mark what robustness is thereb rnd whatever
they may reveal of the divine love in the oon, the soft, curled,
hermaphroditical btalian pictures, in which his idea has been most
successfully embodied  these pictures, so destitute as they are of all
brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative, feminine
one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is conceded, form
the peculiar practical virtues of his teachingsb

ouch is the subtle elasticity of the organ b treat of, that whether
wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it
be in, its flesions are invariably marked by esceeding graceb Iherein no
fairy s arm can transcend itb

rive great motions are peculiar to itb rirst, when used as a fin for
progression  oecond, when used as a mace in battle  Ihird, in sweeping 
rourth, in lobtailing  rifth, in peaking flukesb

rirstI  eing horicontal in its position, the reviathan s tail acts in
a different manner from the tails of all other sea creaturesb bt never
wrigglesb bn man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiorityb Io the
whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsionb ocrollIwise coiled
forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is this
which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster when
furiously swimmingb  is sideIfins only serve to steer byb

oecondI bt is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only
fights another sperm whale with his head and eaw, nevertheless, in his
conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tailb bn
striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the
blow is only inflicted by the recoilb bf it be made in the unobstructed
air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply
irresistibleb so ribs of man or boat can withstand itb eour only
salvation lies in eluding it  but if it comes sideways through the
opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale
boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a dashed
plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the most
serious resultb Ihese submerged side blows are so often received in the
fishery, that they are accounted mere child s playb oome one strips off
a frock, and the hole is stoppedb

IhirdI b cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale
the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail  for in this respect
there is a delicacy in it only ebualled by the daintiness of the
elephant s trunkb Ihis delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of
sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft
slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface
of the sea  and if he feel but a sailor s whisker, woe to that sailor,
whiskers and allb uhat tenderness there is in that preliminary touchs
 ad this tail any prehensile power, b should straightway bethink me of
rarmonodes  elephant that so frebuented the flowerImarket, and with
low salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their
conesb en more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not
possess this prehensile virtue in his tail  for b have heard of yet
another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his trunk
and estracted the dartb

rourthI otealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the
middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence
of his dignity, and kittenIlike, he plays on the ocean as if it were a
hearthb  ut still you see his power in his playb Ihe broad palms of
his tail are flirted high into the air  then smiting the surface, the
thunderous concussion resounds for milesb eou would almost think a great
gun had been discharged  and if you noticed the light wreath of vapour
from the spiracle at his other estremity, you would think that that was
the smoke from the touchIholeb

rifthI rs in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes
lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely
out of sight beneath the surface  but when he is about to plunge into
the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are
tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they
downwards shoot out of viewb sscepting the sublime   srs IIsomewhere
else to be describedIIthis peaking of the whale s flukes is perhaps the
grandest sight to be seen in all animated natureb eut of the bottomless
profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the
highest heavenb oo in dreams, have b seen maeestic oatan thrusting forth
his tormented colossal claw from the flame  altic of  ellb  ut in
gacing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in  if in
the rantean, the devils will occur to you  if in that of bsaiah, the
archangelsb otanding at the mastIhead of my ship during a sunrise that
crimsoned sky and sea, b once saw a large herd of whales in the east,
all heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with
peaked flukesb rs it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment
of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in 
ersia, the home of
the fire worshippersb rs 
tolemy 
hilopater testified of the rfrican
elephant, b then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout
of all beingsb ror according to ning iuba, the military elephants of
antibuity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the
profoundest silenceb

Ihe chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the
elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk
of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two
opposite organs on an ebuality, much less the creatures to which they
respectively belongb ror as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier
to reviathan, so, compared with reviathan s tail, his trunk is but the
stalk of a lilyb Ihe most direful blow from the elephant s trunk were as
the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and crash
of the sperm whale s ponderous flukes, which in repeated instances have
one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews
into the air, very much as an bndian euggler tosses his ballsbi


iIhough all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale
and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the
elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to
the elephant  nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of curious
similitude  among these is the spoutb bt is well known that the elephant
will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then elevating it,
eet it forth in a streamb


Ihe more b consider this mighty tail, the more do b deplore my inability
to espress itb rt times there are gestures in it, which, though they
would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly inesplicableb bn an
estensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are these mystic gestures,
that b have heard hunters who have declared them akin to rreeI ason

Is   db Ihe  rand rrmadab


Ihe long and narrow peninsula of  alacca, estending southIeastward from
the territories of  irmah, forms the most southerly point of all rsiab
bn a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of
oumatra, iava,  ally, and Iimor  which, with many others, form a
vast mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting rsia with rustralia,
and dividing the long unbroken bndian ocean from the thickly studded
oriental archipelagoesb Ihis rampart is pierced by several sallyIports
for the convenience of ships and whales  conspicuous among which are the
straits of ounda and  alaccab  y the straits of ounda, chiefly, vessels
bound to shina from the west, emerge into the shina seasb

Ihose narrow straits of ounda divide oumatra from iava  and standing
midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green
promontory, known to seamen as iava  ead  they not a little correspond
to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empireI and
considering the ineshaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and eewels,
and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental
sea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of nature, that such
treasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least bear the
appearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the allIgrasping
western worldb Ihe shores of the otraits of ounda are unsupplied
with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the
 editerranean, the  altic, and the 
ropontisb bnlike the ranes, these
erientals do not demand the obsebuious homage of lowered topIsails from
the endless procession of ships before the wind, which for centuries
past, by night and by day, have passed between the islands of oumatra
and iava, freighted with the costliest cargoes of the eastb  ut while
they freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce
their claim to more solid tributeb

Iime out of mind the piratical proas of the  alays, lurking among
the low shaded coves and islets of oumatra, have sallied out upon the
vessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the
point of their spearsb Ihough by the repeated bloody chastisements they
have received at the hands of suropean cruisers, the audacity of these
corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed  yet, even at the present
day, we occasionally hear of snglish and rmerican vessels, which, in
those waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillagedb

uith a fair, fresh wind, the 
ebuod was now drawing nigh to these
straits  rhab purposing to pass through them into the iavan sea, and
thence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frebuented here and
there by the operm uhale, sweep inshore by the 
hilippine bslands, and
gain the far coast of iapan, in time for the great whaling season thereb
 y these means, the circumnavigating 
ebuod would sweep almost all the
known operm uhale cruising grounds of the world, previous to descending
upon the rine in the 
acific  where rhab, though everywhere else foiled
in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to  oby rick, in the
sea he was most known to frebuent  and at a season when he might most
reasonably be presumed to be haunting itb

 ut how nown in this coned buest, does rhab touch no landn does his crew

have gone to shina from sew eork, and back again, touching at a score
of ports, the whaleIship, in all that interval, may not have sighted
one grain of soil  her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like
themselvesb oo that did you carry them the news that another flood had
come  they would only answerII uell, boys, here s the arks 

sow, as many operm uhales had been captured off the western coast of
iava, in the near vicinity of the otraits of ounda  indeed, as most of
the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an
escellent spot for cruising  therefore, as the 
ebuod gained more
and more upon iava  ead, the lookIouts were repeatedly hailed, and
admonished to keep wide awakeb  ut though the green palmy cliffs of the
land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils
the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single eet was
descriedb rlmost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game
hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the
customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle of
singular magnificence saluted usb

 ut here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with which
of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the operm uhales,
instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies, as in
former times, are now frebuently met with in estensive herds, sometimes
embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost seem as if
numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual
assistance and protectionb Io this aggregation of the operm uhale into
such immense caravans, may be imputed the circumstance that even in the
best cruising grounds, you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months
together, without being greeted by a single spout  and then be suddenly
saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousandsb

 road on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and
forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horicon,
a continuous chain of whaleIeets were upIplaying and sparkling in the
noonIday airb bnlike the straight perpendicular twinIeets of the  ight
uhale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the cleft
drooping boughs of a willow, the single forwardIslanting spout of the
operm uhale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually
rising and falling away to leewardb

oeen from the 
ebuod s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of
the sea, this host of vapoury spouts, individually curling up into the
air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish hace, showed
like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried
of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a heightb

rs marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,
accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in
their rear, and once more espand in comparative security upon the plain 
even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through
the straits  gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle, and
swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centreb

srowding all sail the 
ebuod pressed after them  the harpooneers
handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their
yet suspended boatsb bf the wind only held, little doubt had they, that
chased through these otraits of ounda, the vast host would only deploy
into the eriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their
numberb rnd who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan,  oby
rick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped
whiteIelephant in the coronation procession of the oiameses oo with
stunIsail piled on stunIsail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans
before us  when, of a sudden, the voice of Iashtego was heard, loudly
directing attention to something in our wakeb

sorresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rearb
bt seemed formed of detached white vapours, rising and falling something
like the spouts of the whales  only they did not so completely come and
go  for they constantly hovered, without finally disappearingb revelling
his glass at this sight, rhab buickly revolved in his pivotIhole,
crying,  rloft there, and rig whips and buckets to wet the
sails II alays, sir, and after uss 

rs if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the 
ebuod should
fairly have entered the straits, these rascally rsiatics were now in hot
pursuit, to make up for their overIcautious delayb  ut when the swift

ebuod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase  how very
kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to
her own chosen pursuit,IImere ridingIwhips and rowels to her, that they
wereb rs with glass under arm, rhab toIandIfro paced the deck  in his
forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one the
bloodthirsty pirates chasing him  some such fancy as the above seemed
hisb rnd when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in
which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that through that
gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that
same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end 
and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and
inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their
curses IIwhen all these conceits had passed through his brain, rhab s
brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after some
stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm
thing from its placeb

 ut thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew  and
when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the

ebuod at last shot by the vivid green sockatoo 
oint on the oumatra
side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond  then, the
harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining
upon the ship, than to reeoice that the ship had so victoriously gained
upon the  alaysb  ut still driving on in the wake of the whales, at
length they seemed abating their speed  gradually the ship neared them 
and the wind now dying away, word was passed to spring to the boatsb  ut
no sooner did the herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct of the operm
uhale, become notified of the three keels that were after them,IIthough
as yet a mile in their rear,IIthan they rallied again, and forming
in close ranks and battalions, so that their spouts all looked like
flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocityb

otripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the whiteIash, and
after several hours  pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase,
when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating
token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange
perplesity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive
it in the whale, they say he is galliedb Ihe compact martial columns
in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now
broken up in one measureless rout  and like ning 
orus  elephants in the
bndian battle with rlesander, they seemed going mad with consternationb
bn all directions espanding in vast irregular circles, and aimlessly
swimming hither and thither, by their short thick spoutings, they
plainly betrayed their distraction of panicb Ihis was still more
strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely paralysed
as it were, helplessly floated like waterIlogged dismantled ships on the
seab  ad these reviathans been but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over
the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not possibly have evinced
such escessive dismayb  ut this occasional timidity is characteristic
of almost all herding creaturesb Ihough banding together in tens of
thousands, the lionImaned buffaloes of the uest have fled before a
solitary horsemanb uitness, too, all human beings, how when herded
together in the sheepfold of a theatre s pit, they will, at the
slightest alarm of fire, rush helterIskelter for the outlets, crowding,
trampling, eamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to deathb  est,
therefore, withhold any amacement at the strangely gallied whales
before us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not
infinitely outdone by the madness of menb

Ihough many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,
yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor
retreated, but collectively remained in one placeb rs is customary in
those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one
lone whale on the outskirts of the shoalb bn about three minutes  time,
eueebueg s harpoon was flung  the stricken fish darted blinding spray
in our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered straight
for the heart of the herdb Ihough such a movement on the part of the
whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented  and
indeed is almost always more or less anticipated  yet does it present
one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fisheryb ror as the swift
monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid
adieu to circumspect life and only esist in a delirious throbb

rs, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of
speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him  as we
thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by
the craced creatures to and fro rushing about us  our beset boat was
like a ship mobbed by iceIisles in a tempest, and striving to steer
through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what
moment it may be locked in and crushedb

 ut not a bit daunted, eueebueg steered us manfully  now sheering off
from this monster directly across our route in advance  now edging away
from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the
time, otarbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our
way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no time
to make long onesb sor were the oarsmen buite idle, though their wonted
duty was now altogether dispensed withb Ihey chiefly attended to the
shouting part of the businessb  eut of the way, sommodores  cried one,
to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,
and for an instant threatened to swamp usb   ard down with your tail,
theres  cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed
calmly cooling himself with his own fanIlike estremityb

rll whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented
by the santucket bndians, called druggsb Iwo thick sbuares of wood
of ebual sice are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each
other s grain at right angles  a line of considerable length is then
attached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line
being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoonb bt is chiefly
among gallied whales that this drugg is usedb ror then, more whales
are close round you than you can possibly chase at one timeb  ut sperm
whales are not every day encountered  while you may, then, you must
kill all you canb rnd if you cannot kill them all at once, you must wing
them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisureb  ence it
is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into rebuisitionb eur boat
was furnished with three of themb Ihe first and second were successfully
darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the
enormous sidelong resistance of the towing druggb Ihey were cramped like
malefactors with the chain and ballb  ut upon flinging the third, in the
act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one
of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and carried it
away, dropping the oarsman in the boat s bottom as the seat slid from
under himb en both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks, but we
stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for
the timeb

bt had been nest to impossible to dart these druggedIharpoons, were
it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale s way greatly
diminished  moreover, that as we went still further and further from the
circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waningb oo that
when at last the eerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways
vanished  then, with the tapering force of his parting momentum, we
glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal, as if
from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lakeb  ere
the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard
but not feltb bn this central espanse the sea presented that smooth
satinIlike surface, called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture
thrown off by the whale in his more buiet moodsb ees, we were now
in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every
commotionb rnd still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of
the outer concentric circles, and saw successive pods of whales, eight
or ten in each, swiftly going round and round, like multiplied spans of
horses in a ring  and so closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Iitanic
circusIrider might easily have overIarched the middle ones, and so have
gone round on their backsb ewing to the density of the crowd of reposing
whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed asis of the herd, no
possible chance of escape was at present afforded usb ue must watch for
a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in  the wall that had only
admitted us in order to shut us upb neeping at the centre of the lake,
we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves  the women
and children of this routed hostb

sow, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving
outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in
any one of those circles, the entire area at this euncture, embraced by
the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three sbuare
milesb rt any rateIIthough indeed such a test at such a time might be
deceptiveIIspoutings might be discovered from our low boat that
seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horiconb b mention this
circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely
locked up in this innermost fold  and as if the wide estent of the
herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its
stopping  or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way
innocent and inesperienced  however it may have been, these smaller
whalesIInow and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the
lakeIIevinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still

stranger world met our eyes as we gaced over the sideb ror, suspended
in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the
whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to
become mothersb Ihe lake, as b have hinted, was to a considerable depth
esceedingly transparent  and as human infants while suckling will calmly
and fisedly gace away from the breast, as if leading two different
lives at the time  and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still
spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence IIeven so did the
young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if
we were but a bit of  ulfweed in their newIborn sightb rloating on their
sides, the mothers also seemed buietly eyeing usb ene of these little
infants, that from certain bueer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might
have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some sis feet in
girthb  e was a little frisky  though as yet his body seemed scarce yet
recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the
maternal reticule  where, tail to head, and all ready for the final
spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Iartar s bowb Ihe delicate
sideIfins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the
plaited crumpled appearance of a baby s ears newly arrived from foreign
partsb

rs when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of
fathoms of rope  as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and shows
the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the
air  so now, otarbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of  adame
reviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its damb sot
seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with
the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the hempen one, so that
the cub is thereby trappedb oome of the subtlest secrets of the seas

amours in the deepbi


iIhe sperm whale, as with all other species of the reviathan, but unlike
most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons  after a gestation
which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but one at a
time  though in some few known instances giving birth to an ssau and
iacobIIIa contingency provided for in suckling by two teats, curiously
situated, one on each side of the anus  but the breasts themselves
estend upwards from thatb uhen by chance these precious parts in a
nursing whale are cut by the hunter s lance, the mother s pouring milk
and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rodsb Ihe milk is very sweet
and rich  it has been tasted by man  it might do well with strawberriesb
uhen overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute  e s  e bsb b


rnd thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations
and affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and
fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments  yea, serenely revelled
in dalliance and delightb  ut even so, amid the tornadoed rtlantic of
my being, do b myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm  and
while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and
deep inland there b still bathe me in eternal mildness of eoyb

 eanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic
spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,
still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host  or
possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance of
room and some convenient retreats were afforded themb  ut the sight
of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro
across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyesb bt is
sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful
and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or
maiming his gigantic tailItendonb bt is done by darting a shortIhandled
cuttingIspade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back againb
r whale wounded ias we afterwards learnedi in this part, but not
effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying along
with him half of the harpoon line  and in the estraordinary agony of
the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone
mounted desperado rrnold, at the battle of oaratoga, carrying dismay
wherever he wentb

 ut agonicing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle
enough, any way  yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to
inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first the
intervening distance obscured from usb  ut at length we perceived that
by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale had
become entangled in the harpoonIline that he towed  he had also run
away with the cuttingIspade in him  and while the free end of the rope
attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the
harpoonIline round his tail, the cuttingIspade itself had worked loose
from his fleshb oo that tormented to madness, he was now churning
through the water, violently flailing with his flesible tail, and
tossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own
comradesb

Ihis terrific obeect seemed to recall the whole herd from their
stationary frightb rirst, the whales forming the margin of our lake
began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted
by half spent billows from afar  then the lake itself began faintly to
heave and swell  the submarine bridalIchambers and nurseries vanished 
in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central
circles began to swim in thickening clustersb ees, the long calm was
departingb r low advancing hum was soon heard  and then like to the
tumultuous masses of blockIice when the great river  udson breaks up in
opring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre,
as if to pile themselves up in one common mountainb bnstantly otarbuck

Ihe boat was now all but eammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a
narrow rardanelles between their long lengthsb  ut by desperate endeavor
we at last shot into a temporary opening  then giving way rapidly,
and at the same time earnestly watching for another outletb rfter many
similar hairIbreadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into what had
eust been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random whales,
all violently making for one centreb Ihis lucky salvation was cheaply
purchased by the loss of eueebueg s hat, who, while standing in the bows
to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his head by
the airIeddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close
byb

 iotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon
resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement  for having
clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their
onward flight with augmented fleetnessb rurther pursuit was useless  but
the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales
might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which rlask had
killed and waifedb Ihe waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of which
are carried by every boat  and which, when additional game is at hand,
are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both to
mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession, should
the boats of any other ship draw nearb

Ihe result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious
saying in the rishery,IIthe more whales the less fishb ef all the
drugged whales only one was capturedb Ihe rest contrived to escape for
the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some other
craft than the

s r
Is    b ochools and ochoolmastersb


Ihe previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of operm
uhales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those
vast aggregationsb

sow, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must
have been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are
occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals eachb
ouch bands are known as schoolsb Ihey generally are of two sorts  those
composed almost entirely of females, and those mustering none but young
vigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designatedb

bn cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a
male of full grown magnitude, but not old  who, upon any alarm, evinces
his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his
ladiesb bn truth, this gentleman is a lusurious ettoman, swimming about
over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces
and endearments of the haremb Ihe contrast between this ettoman and
his concubines is striking  because, while he is always of the largest
leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not
more than oneIthird of the bulk of an averageIsiced maleb Ihey are
comparatively delicate, indeed  b dare say, not to esceed half a docen
yards round the waistb severtheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the
whole they are hereditarily entitled to s  es
ebsIb

bt is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent
ramblingsb rike fashionables, they are for ever on the move in leisurely
search of varietyb eou meet them on the rine in time for the full flower
of the sbuatorial feeding season, having eust returned, perhaps, from
spending the summer in the sorthern seas, and so cheating summer of all
unpleasant weariness and warmthb  y the time they have lounged up and
down the promenade of the sbuator awhile, they start for the eriental
waters in anticipation of the cool season there, and so evade the other
escessive temperature of the yearb

uhen serenely advancing on one of these eourneys, if any strange
suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his
interesting familyb ohould any unwarrantably pert young reviathan coming
that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies,
with what prodigious fury the  ashaw assails him, and chases him aways
 igh times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be
permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss  though do what the
 ashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious rothario out of his bed 
for, alass all fish bed in commonb rs ashore, the ladies often cause the
most terrible duels among their rival admirers  eust so with the whales,
who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for loveb Ihey fence with
their long lower eaws, sometimes locking them together, and so striving
for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlersb sot
a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters,IIfurrowed
heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins  and in some instances, wrenched and
dislocated mouthsb

 ut supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at
the first rush of the harem s lord, then is it very diverting to watch
that lordb  ently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and
revels there awhile, still in tantalicing vicinity to young rothario,
like pious oolomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubinesb
 ranting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give
chase to one of these  rand Iurks  for these  rand Iurks are too lavish
of their strength, and hence their unctuousness is smallb rs for the
sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must
take care of themselves  at least, with only the maternal helpb ror
like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my rord
uhale has no taste for the nursery, however much for the bower  and so,
being a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all over the
world  every baby an esoticb bn good time, nevertheless, as the ardour
of youth declines  as years and dumps increase  as reflection lends
her solemn pauses  in short, as a general lassitude overtakes the sated
Iurk  then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens  our
ettoman enters upon the impotent, repentant, admonitory stage of life,
forswears, disbands the harem, and grown to an esemplary, sulky old
soul, goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his
prayers, and warning each young reviathan from his amorous errorsb

sow, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so
is the lord and master of that school technically known as the
schoolmasterb bt is therefore not in strict character, however admirably
satirical, that after going to school himself, he should then go abroad
inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly of itb  is title,
schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed
upon the harem itself, but some have surmised that the man who first
thus entitled this sort of ettoman whale, must have read the memoirs of
iidocb, and informed himself what sort of a countryIschoolmaster that
famous rrenchman was in his younger days, and what was the nature of
those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupilsb

Ihe same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale
betakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged operm
uhalesb rlmost universally, a lone whaleIIas a solitary reviathan is
calledIIproves an ancient oneb rike venerable mossIbearded raniel  oone,
he will have no one near him but sature herself  and her he takes to
wife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though
she keeps so many moody secretsb

Ihe schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously
mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schoolsb ror while
those female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or
fortyIbarrelIbulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious
of all reviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter 
escepting those wondrous greyIheaded, griccled whales, sometimes met,
and these will fight you like grim fiends esasperated by a penal goutb

Ihe rortyIbarrelIbull schools are larger than the harem schoolsb rike
a mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness,
tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no
prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous
lad at eale or  arvardb Ihey soon relinbuish this turbulence though,
and when about threeIfourths grown, break up, and separately go about in
buest of settlements, that is, haremsb

rnother point of difference between the male and female schools is
still more characteristic of the sesesb oay you strike a
rortyIbarrelIbullIIpoor devils all his comrades buit himb  ut strike
a member of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with
every token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as
themselves to fall a preyb



s r
Is    b rastIrish and rooseIrishb


Ihe allusion to the waif and waifIpoles in the last chapter but one,
necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale
fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badgeb

bt frebuently happens that when several ships are cruising in company,
a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed
and captured by another vessel  and herein are indirectly comprised
many minor contingencies, all partaking of this one grand featureb ror
esample,IIafter a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale,
the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm  and
drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a
calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or lineb Ihus
the most vesatious and violent disputes would often arise between
the fishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal,
undisputed law applicable to all casesb


erhaps the only formal whaling code authoriced by legislative
enactment, was that of  ollandb bt was decreed by the otatesI eneral in
rbrb  i db  ut though no other nation has ever had any written whaling
law, yet the rmerican fishermen have been their own legislators and
lawyers in this matterb Ihey have provided a system which for terse
comprehensiveness surpasses iustinian s 
andects and the  yIlaws of
the shinese oociety for the ouppression of  eddling with other 
eople s
 usinessb ees  these laws might be engraven on a eueen rnne s farthing,
or the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small are theyb

bb r rastIrish belongs to the party fast to itb

bbb r rooseIrish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch itb

 ut what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable
brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to
espound itb

rirstI uhat is a rastIrishn rlive or dead a fish is technically fast,
when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at all
controllable by the occupant or occupants,IIa mast, an oar, a nineIinch
cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the sameb
rikewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any other
recognised symbol of possession  so long as the party waifing it plainly
evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well as their
intention so to dob

Ihese are scientific commentaries  but the commentaries of the whalemen
themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocksIIthe
sokeIuponIrittleton of the fistb Irue, among the more upright and
honourable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases,
where it would be an outrageous moral ineustice for one party to claim
possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another partyb  ut
others are by no means so scrupulousb

oome fifty years ago there was a curious case of whaleItrover litigated
in sngland, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of
a whale in the sorthern seas  and when indeed they ithe plaintiffsi had
succeeded in harpooning the fish  they were at last, through peril of
their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat
itselfb bltimately the defendants ithe crew of another shipi came up
with the whale, struck, killed, seiced, and finally appropriated it
before the very eyes of the plaintiffsb rnd when those defendants were
remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs 
teeth, and assured them that by way of dosology to the deed he had done,
he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had remained
attached to the whale at the time of the seicureb uherefore the
plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale, line,
harpoons, and boatb

 rb srskine was counsel for the defendants  rord sllenborough was
the eudgeb bn the course of the defence, the witty srskine went on
to illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crimb conb
case, wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife s
viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life  but in
the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to
recover possession of herb srskine was on the other side  and he
then supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally
harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of the
great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned her  yet
abandon her he did, so that she became a looseIfish  and therefore
when a subsebuent gentleman reIharpooned her, the lady then became that
subsebuent gentleman s property, along with whatever harpoon might have
been found sticking in herb

sow in the present case srskine contended that the esamples of the whale
and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each otherb

Ihese pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very
learned iudge in set terms decided, to wit,IIIhat as for the boat, he
awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it
to save their lives  but that with regard to the controverted whale,
harpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants  the whale, because
it was a rooseIrish at the time of the final capture  and the harpoons
and line because when the fish made off with them, it ithe fishi
acbuired a property in those articles  and hence anybody who afterwards
took the fish had a right to themb sow the defendants afterwards took
the fish  ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirsb

r common man looking at this decision of the very learned iudge, might
possibly obeect to itb  ut ploughed up to the primary rock of the
matter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws
previously buoted, and applied and elucidated by rord sllenborough in
the above cited case  these two laws touching rastIrish and rooseIrish,
b say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human
eurisprudence  for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture,
the Iemple of the raw, like the Iemple of the 
hilistines, has but two
props to stand onb

bs it not a saying in every one s mouth, 
ossession is half of the lawI
that is, regardless of how the thing came into possessionn  ut often
possession is the whole of the lawb uhat are the sinews and souls of
 ussian serfs and  epublican slaves but rastIrish, whereof possession is
the whole of the lawn uhat to the rapacious landlord is the widow s last
mite but a rastIrishn uhat is yonder undetected villain s marble mansion

the kindred doctrine of rooseIrish is still more widely sob Ihat is

ratin from the books of the raws of sngland, which taken along with the
contest, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of
that land, the ning, as  onourary  rand  arpooneer, must have the head,
and the eueen be respectfully presented with the tailb r division which,
in the whale, is much like halving an apple  there is no intermediate
remainderb sow as this law, under a modified form, is to this day in
force in sngland  and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly
touching the general law of rast and rooseIrish, it is here treated of
in a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle that prompts
the snglish railways to be at the espense of a separate car, specially
reserved for the accommodation of royaltyb bn the first place, in
curious proof of the fact that the aboveImentioned law is still in
force, b proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within
the last two yearsb

bt seems that some honest mariners of rover, or oandwich, or some one
of the sinbue 
orts, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and
beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from
the shoreb sow the sinbue 
orts are partially or somehow under the
eurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a rord uardenb
 olding the office directly from the crown, b believe, all the royal
emoluments incident to the sinbue 
ort territories become by assignment
hisb  y some writers this office is called a sinecureb  ut not sob
 ecause the rord uarden is busily employed at times in fobbing his
perbuisites  which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of
themb

sow when these poor sunIburnt mariners, bareIfooted, and with their
trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their fat
fish high and dry, promising themselves a good r dn from the precious
oil and bone  and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives, and good
ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their respective shares  up
steps a very learned and most shristian and charitable gentleman, with
a copy of  lackstone under his arm  and laying it upon the whale s head,
he saysII  ands offs this fish, my masters, is a rastIrishb b seice it
as the rord uarden sb  bpon this the poor mariners in their respectful
consternationIIso truly snglishIIknowing not what to say, fall to
vigorously scratching their heads all round  meanwhile ruefully glancing
from the whale to the strangerb  ut that did in nowise mend the matter,
or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy
of  lackstoneb rt length one of them, after long scratching about for
his ideas, made bold to speak,

 bt is hisb 

 b thought to relieve my old bedIridden mother by part of my share of
this whaleb 

 bt is hisb 

 uon t the ruke be content with a buarter or a halfn 

 bt is hisb 

bn a word, the whale was seiced and sold, and his  race the ruke of
uellington received the moneyb Ihinking that viewed in some particular
lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be
deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman
of the town respectfully addressed a note to his  race, begging him to
take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full considerationb Io
which my rord ruke in substance replied iboth letters were publishedi
that he had already done so, and received the money, and would be
obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he ithe reverend
gentlemani would decline meddling with other people s businessb bs
this the still militant old man, standing at the corners of the three
kingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggarsn

bt will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the
ruke to the whale was a delegated one from the oovereignb ue must needs
inbuire then on what principle the oovereign is originally invested with
that rightb Ihe law itself has already been set forthb  ut 
lowdon gives
us the reason for itb oays 
lowdon, the whale so caught belongs to
the ning and eueen,  because of its superior escellenceb  rnd by the
soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such
mattersb

 ut why should the ning have the head, and the eueen the tailn r reason
for that, ye lawyerss

author, one uilliam 
rynne, thus discoursethI  ee tail is ye eueen s,
that ye eueen s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whaleboneb  sow this
was written at a time when the black limber bone of the  reenland or
 ight whale was largely used in ladies  bodicesb  ut this same bone
is not in the tail  it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for
a sagacious lawyer like 
rynneb  ut is the eueen a mermaid, to be
presented with a tailn rn allegorical meaning may lurk hereb

Ihere are two royal fish so styled by the snglish law writersIIthe whale
and the sturgeon  both royal property under certain limitations, and
nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown s ordinary revenueb
b know not that any other author has hinted of the matter  but by
inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same
way as the whale, the ning receiving the highly dense and elastic head
peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be
humorously grounded upon some presumed congenialityb rnd thus there
seems a reason in all things, even in lawb

by no means of the nature of attarIofIroseb

soming still nearer with the espiring breece, we saw that the rrenchman
had a second whale alongside  and this second whale seemed even more
of a nosegay than the firstb bn truth, it turned out to be one of
those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort
of prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion  leaving their defunct bodies
almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oilb severtheless, in the
proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn
up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted
whales in generalb

Ihe 
ebuod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that otubb vowed
he recognised his cutting spadeIpole entangled in the lines that were
knotted round the tail of one of these whalesb

 Ihere s a pretty fellow, now,  he banteringly laughed, standing in the
ship s bows,  there s a eackal for yes b well know that these srappoes
of rrenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery  sometimes lowering
their boats for breakers, mistaking them for operm uhale spouts  yes,
and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boses of
tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they
will get won t be enough to dip the saptain s wick into  aye, we all
know these things  but look ye, here s a srappo that is content with our
leavings, the drugged whale there, b mean  aye, and is content too with
scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has thereb 
oor
devils b say, pass round a hat, some one, and let s make him a present
of a little oil for dear charity s sakeb ror what oil he ll get from
that drugged whale there, wouldn t be fit to burn in a eail  no, not
in a condemned cellb rnd as for the other whale, why, b ll agree to get
more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours, than
he ll get from that bundle of bones  though, now that b think of it, it
may contain something worth a good deal more than oil  yes, ambergrisb
b wonder now if our old man has thought of thatb bt s worth tryingb ees,
b m for it   and so saying he started for the buarterIdeckb

 y this time the faint air had become a complete calm  so that whether
or no, the 
ebuod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of
escaping escept by its breecing up againb bssuing from the cabin, otubb
now called his boat s crew, and pulled off for the strangerb rrawing
across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful rrench
taste, the upper part of her stemIpiece was carved in the likeness of a
huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns had copper
spikes proeecting from it here and there  the whole terminating in a
symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colourb bpon her head boards, in
large gilt letters, he read   outon de  ose, II oseIbutton, or  oseIbud 
and this was the romantic name of this aromatic shipb

Ihough otubb did not understand the  ebIes part of the inscription, yet
the word  eos, and the bulbous figureIhead put together, sufficiently
esplained the whole to himb

 r wooden roseIbud, ehn  he cried with his hand to his nose,  that will
do very well  but how like all creation it smellss 

sow in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he
had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to
the blasted whale  and so talk over itb

rrrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he
bawledII  outonIdeI ose, ahoys are there any of you  outonIdeI oses that
speak snglishn 

 ees,  reeoined a  uernseyIman from the bulwarks, who turned out to be
the chiefImateb

 uell, then, my  outonIdeI oseIbud, have you seen the uhite uhalen

 iery good, then  good bye now, and b ll call again in a minuteb 

Ihen rapidly pulling back towards the 
ebuod, and seeing rhab leaning
over the buarterIdeck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands
into a trumpet and shoutedII so, oirs sos  bpon which rhab retired, and
otubb returned to the rrenchmanb

 e now perceived that the  uernseyIman, who had eust got into the
chains, and was using a cuttingIspade, had slung his nose in a sort of
bagb

 uhat s the matter with your nose, theren  said otubbb   roke itn 

 b wish it was broken, or that b didn t have any nose at alls  answered
the  uernseyIman, who did not seem to relish the eob he was at very
muchb   ut what are you holding eeb o forn 

 eh, nothings bt s a was nose  b have to hold it onb rine day, ain t itn
rir rather gardenny, b should say  throw us a bunch of posies, will ye,
 outonIdeI osen 

 uhat in the devil s name do you want heren  roared the  uernseyman,
flying into a sudden passionb

 ehs keep coolIIcooln yes, that s the words why don t you pack those
whales in ice while you re working at  emn  ut eoking aside, though  do
you know,  oseIbud, that it s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of
such whalesn rs for that dried up one, there, he hasn t a gill in his
whole carcaseb 

 b know that well enough  but, d ye see, the saptain here won t believe
it  this is his first voyage  he was a sologne manufacturer beforeb  ut
come aboard, and mayhap he ll believe you, if he won t me  and so b ll
get out of this dirty scrapeb 

 rnything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,  reeoined otubb,
and with that he soon mounted to the deckb Ihere a bueer scene presented
itselfb Ihe sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the
heavy tackles in readiness for the whalesb  ut they worked rather slow
and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good humorb rll their
noses upwardly proeected from their faces like so many eibIboomsb
sow and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up to the
mastIhead to get some fresh airb oome thinking they would catch the
plague, dipped oakum in coalItar, and at intervals held it to their
nostrilsb ethers having broken the stems of their pipes almost short
off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobaccoIsmoke, so that it
constantly filled their olfactoriesb

otubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from
the saptain s roundIhouse abaft  and looking in that direction saw a
fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held aear from withinb
Ihis was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating
against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself to the saptain s
roundIhouse isr bssI he called iti to avoid the pest  but still, could
not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at timesb

 arking all this, otubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the
 uernseyIman had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate
espressed his detestation of his saptain as a conceited ignoramus,
who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickleb
oounding him carefully, otubb further perceived that the  uernseyIman
had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergrisb  e therefore
held his peace on that head, but otherwise was buite frank and
confidential with him, so that the two buickly concocted a little plan
for both circumventing and satiricing the saptain, without his at all
dreaming of distrusting their sincerityb rccording to this little plan
of theirs, the  uernseyIman, under cover of an interpreter s office, was
to tell the saptain what he pleased, but as coming from otubb  and as
for otubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in
him during the interviewb

 y this time their destined victim appeared from his cabinb  e was a
small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a seaIcaptain, with
large whiskers and moustache, however  and wore a red cotton velvet vest
with watchIseals at his sideb Io this gentleman, otubb was now politely
introduced by the  uernseyIman, who at once ostentatiously put on the
aspect of interpreting between themb

 uhat shall b say to him firstn  said heb

 uhy,  said otubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals,  you
may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,
though b don t pretend to be a eudgeb 

  e says,  onsieur,  said the  uernseyIman, in rrench, turning to his
captain,  that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain
and chiefImate, with sis sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a
blasted whale they had brought alongsideb 

bpon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know moreb

 uhat nown  said the  uernseyIman to otubbb

 uhy, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now b have eyed him
carefully, b m buite certain that he s no more fit to command a
whaleIship than a otb iago monkeyb bn fact, tell him from me he s a
baboonb 

  e vows and declares,  onsieur, that the other whale, the dried one, is
far more deadly than the blasted one  in fine,  onsieur, he coneures us,
as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fishb 

bnstantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his
crew to desist from hoisting the cuttingItackles, and at once cast loose
the cables and chains confining the whales to the shipb

 uhat nown  said the  uernseyIman, when the saptain had returned to
themb

 uhy, let me see  yes, you may as well tell him now thatIIthatIIin
fact, tell him b ve diddled him, and iaside to himselfi perhaps somebody
elseb 

  e says,  onsieur, that he s very happy to have been of any service to
usb 

 earing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties
imeaning himself and matei and concluded by inviting otubb down into his
cabin to drink a bottle of  ordeausb

  e wants you to take a glass of wine with him,  said the interpreterb

 Ihank him heartily  but tell him it s against my principles to drink
with the man b ve diddledb bn fact, tell him b must gob 

  e says,  onsieur, that his principles won t admit of his drinking  but
that if  onsieur wants to live another day to drink, then  onsieur had
best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales, for
it s so calm they won t driftb 

 y this time otubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed
the  uernseyIman to this effect,IIthat having a long towIline in his
boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the lighter
whale of the two from the ship s sideb uhile the rrenchman s boats,
then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, otubb benevolently towed
away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously slacking out a most
unusually long towIlineb


resently a breece sprang up  otubb feigned to cast off from the whale 
hoisting his boats, the rrenchman soon increased his distance, while the

ebuod slid in between him and otubb s whaleb uhereupon otubb buickly
pulled to the floating body, and hailing the 
ebuod to give notice of
his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous
cunningb oeicing his sharp boatIspade, he commenced an escavation in the
body, a little behind the side finb eou would almost have thought he was
digging a cellar there in the sea  and when at length his spade struck
against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old  oman tiles and
pottery buried in fat snglish loamb  is boat s crew were all in high
escitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking as ansious as
goldIhuntersb

rnd all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and
screaming, and yelling, and fighting around themb otubb was beginning
to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased, when
suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a faint
stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells without
being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then along with
another, without at all blending with it for a timeb

 b have it, b have it,  cried otubb, with delight, striking something in
the subterranean regions,  a purses a purses 

rropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls
of something that looked like ripe uindsor soap, or rich mottled old
cheese  very unctuous and savory withalb eou might easily dent it with
your thumb  it is of a hue between yellow and ash colourb rnd this, good
friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggistb
oome sis handfuls were obtained  but more was unavoidably lost in the
sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were it not for
impatient rhab s loud command to otubb to desist, and come on board,
else the ship would bid them good byeb



s r
Is   db rmbergrisb


sow this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as
an article of commerce, that in  d   a certain santucketIborn saptain
soffin was esamined at the bar of the snglish  ouse of sommons on that
subeectb ror at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,
the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem
to the learnedb Ihough the word ambergris is but the rrench compound for
grey amber, yet the two substances are buite distinctb ror amber, though
at times found on the seaIcoast, is also dug up in some far inland
soils, whereas ambergris is never found escept upon the seab  esides,
amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance, used for
mouthIpieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments  but ambergris is soft,
wasy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely used in
perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hairIpowders, and pomatumb
Ihe Iurks use it in cooking, and also carry it to  ecca, for the same
purpose that frankincense is carried to otb 
eter s in  omeb oome wine
merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor itb

uho would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale
themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick
whales eet so it isb  y some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and
by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whaleb  ow to cure such
a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering three or four
boat loads of  randreth s pills, and then running out of harm s way, as
laborers do in blasting rocksb

b have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris, certain
hard, round, bony plates, which at first otubb thought might be sailors 
trowsers buttons  but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing
more than pieces of small sbuid bones embalmed in that mannerb

sow that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be
found in the heart of such decay  is this nothingn  ethink thee of that
saying of otb 
aul in sorinthians, about corruption and incorruption 
how that we are sown in dishonour, but raised in gloryb rnd likewise
call to mind that saying of 
aracelsus about what it is that maketh
the best muskb rlso forget not the strange fact that of all things of
illIsavor, sologneIwater, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is the
worstb

b should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot,
owing to my ansiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen,
and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds, might be
considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of
the rrenchman s two whalesb slsewhere in this volume the slanderous
aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is throughout
a slatternly, untidy businessb  ut there is another thing to rebutb Ihey
hint that all whales always smell badb sow how did this odious stigma
originaten

b opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the
 reenland whaling ships in rondon, more than two centuries agob  ecause
those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as
the oouthern ships have always done  but cutting up the fresh blubber in
small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks, and carry
it home in that manner  the shortness of the season in those bcy oeas,
and the sudden and violent storms to which they are esposed, forbidding
any other courseb Ihe consebuence is, that upon breaking into the hold,
and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the  reenland dock, a
savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from escavating an
old city graveIyard, for the foundations of a ryingIinI ospitalb

b partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be
likewise imputed to the esistence on the coast of  reenland, in former
times, of a rutch village called ochmerenburgh or omeerenberg, which
latter name is the one used by the learned rogo ion olack, in his great
work on omells, a testIbook on that subeectb rs its name imports ismeer,
fat  berg, to put upi, this village was founded in order to afford a
place for the blubber of the rutch whale fleet to be tried out, without
being taken home to  olland for that purposeb bt was a collection of
furnaces, fatIkettles, and oil sheds  and when the works were in full
operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savorb  ut all this is
buite different with a oouth oea operm uhaler  which in a voyage of four
years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not,
perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling out  and in the
state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentlessb Ihe truth is, that
living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by
no means creatures of ill odor  nor can whalemen be recognised, as the
people of the middle ages affected to detect a iew in the company, by
the noseb sor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,
when, as a general thing, he eneoys such high health  taking abundance
of esercise  always out of doors  though, it is true, seldom in the
open airb b say, that the motion of a operm uhale s flukes above water
dispenses a perfume, as when a muskIscented lady rustles her dress in a
warm parlorb uhat then shall b liken the operm uhale to for fragrance,
considering his magnituden  ust it not be to that famous elephant, with
eewelled tusks, and redolent with myrrh, which was led out of an bndian
town to do honour to rlesander the  reatn



s r
Is    b Ihe sastawayb


bt was but some few days after encountering the rrenchman, that a most
significant event befell the most insignificant of the 
ebuod s crew  an
event most lamentable  and which ended in providing the sometimes
madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying
prophecy of whatever shattered sebuel might prove her ownb

sow, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boatsb oome
few hands are reserved called shipIkeepers, whose province it is to work
the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whaleb rs a general thing,
these shipIkeepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats 
crewsb  ut if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous
wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a shipIkeeperb bt
was so in the 
ebuod with the little negro 
ippin by nickIname, 
ip by
abbreviationb 
oor 
ips ye have heard of him before  ye must remember
his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so gloomyIeollyb

bn outer aspect, 
ip and roughI oy made a match, like a black pony and a
white one, of ebual developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven in
one eccentric spanb  ut while hapless roughI oy was by nature dull and
torpid in his intellects, 
ip, though over tenderIhearted, was at bottom
very bright, with that pleasant, genial, eolly brightness peculiar to
his tribe  a tribe, which ever eneoy all holidays and festivities with
finer, freer relish than any other raceb ror blacks, the year s calendar

brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy  behold yon lustrous
ebony, panelled in king s cabinetsb  ut 
ip loved life, and all life s
peaceable securities  so that the panicIstriking business in which he
had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his
brightness  though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus temporarily
subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by
strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the
natural lustre with which in his native Iolland sounty in sonnecticut,
he had once enlivened many a fiddler s frolic on the green  and at
melodious evenItide, with his gay haIhas had turned the round horicon
into one starIbelled tambourineb oo, though in the clear air of day,
suspended against a blueIveined neck, the pureIwatered diamond drop
will healthful glow  yet, when the cunning eeweller would show you
the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he lays it against a gloomy
ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun, but by some unnatural
gasesb Ihen come out those fiery effulgences, infernally superb  then
the evilIblacing diamond, once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies,
looks like some crownIeewel stolen from the ning of  ellb  ut let us to
the storyb

bt came to pass, that in the ambergris affair otubb s afterIoarsman
chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become buite maimed 
and, temporarily, 
ip was put into his placeb

Ihe first time otubb lowered with him, 
ip evinced much nervousness 
but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale  and
therefore came off not altogether discreditably  though otubb observing
him, took care, afterwards, to eshort him to cherish his courageousness
to the utmost, for he might often find it needfulb

sow upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale  and as
the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which
happened, in this instance, to be right under poor 
ip s seatb Ihe
involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in
hand, out of the boat  and in such a way, that part of the slack whale
line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as
to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the waterb Ihat
instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly
straightened  and prestos poor 
ip came all foaming up to the chocks
of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken
several turns around his chest and neckb

Iashtego stood in the bowsb  e was full of the fire of the huntb  e
hated 
ip for a poltroonb onatching the boatIknife from its sheath,
he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards otubb,
esclaimed interrogatively,  sutn   eantime 
ip s blue, choked face
plainly looked, ro, for  od s sakes rll passed in a flashb bn less than
half a minute, this entire thing happenedb

 ramn him, cuts  roared otubb  and so the whale was lost and 
ip was
savedb

oo soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed
by yells and esecrations from the crewb Iranbuilly permitting these
irregular cursings to evaporate, otubb then in a plain, businessIlike,
but still half humorous manner, cursed 
ip officially  and that done,
unofficially gave him much wholesome adviceb Ihe substance was, sever
eump from a boat, 
ip, esceptIIbut all the rest was indefinite, as the
soundest advice ever isb sow, in general, oIbsn Ie I s  erI, is your
true motto in whaling  but cases will sometimes happen when rsr
 r e 
I s  erI, is still betterb  oreover, as if perceiving at last that if he
should give undiluted conscientious advice to 
ip, he would be leaving
him too wide a margin to eump in for the future  otubb suddenly dropped
all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command,  otick to the boat,

ip, or by the rord, b won t pick you up if you eump  mind thatb ue
can t afford to lose whales by the likes of you  a whale would sell for
thirty times what you would, 
ip, in rlabamab  ear that in mind, and
don t eump any moreb   ereby perhaps otubb indirectly hinted, that
though man loved his fellow, yet man is a moneyImaking animal, which
propensity too often interferes with his benevolenceb

 ut we are all in the hands of the  ods  and 
ip eumped againb bt was
under very similar circumstances to the first performance  but this time
he did not breast out the line  and hence, when the whale started to
run, 
ip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller s trunkb
rlass otubb was but too true to his wordb bt was a beautiful, bounteous,
blue day  the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away,
all round, to the horicon, like goldIbeater s skin hammered out to the
estremestb  obbing up and down in that sea, 
ip s ebon head showed
like a head of clovesb so boatIknife was lifted when he fell so rapidly
asternb otubb s inesorable back was turned upon him  and the whale was
wingedb bn three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between

ip and otubbb eut from the centre of the sea, poor 
ip turned his
crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though
the loftiest and the brightestb

sow, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the
practised swimmer as to ride in a springIcarriage ashoreb  ut the awful
lonesomeness is intolerableb Ihe intense concentration of self in the
middle of such a heartless immensity, my  ods who can tell itn  ark, how
when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open seaIImark how closely they
hug their ship and only coast along her sidesb

 ut had otubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his faten so  he
did not mean to, at leastb  ecause there were two boats in his wake,
and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to 
ip very
buickly, and pick him up  though, indeed, such considerations towards
oarsmen eeopardiced through their own timidity, is not always manifested
by the hunters in all similar instances  and such instances not
unfrebuently occur  almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so
called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to
military navies and armiesb

 ut it so happened, that those boats, without seeing 
ip, suddenly
spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase  and
otubb s boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent
upon his fish, that 
ip s ringed horicon began to espand around him
miserablyb  y the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him  but
from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot  such, at
least, they said he wasb Ihe sea had eeeringly kept his finite body
up, but drowned the infinite of his soulb sot drowned entirely, thoughb
 ather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of
the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes 
and the miserImerman, uisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps  and among the
eoyous, heartless, everIeuvenile eternities, 
ip saw the multitudinous,
 odIomnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters
heaved the colossal orbsb  e saw  od s foot upon the treadle of the
loom, and spoke it  and therefore his shipmates called him madb oo man s
insanity is heaven s sense  and wandering from all mortal reason, man
comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is absurd and
frantic  and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent as his
 odb

ror the rest, blame not otubb too hardlyb Ihe thing is common in that
fishery  and in the sebuel of the narrative, it will then be seen what
like abandonment befell myselfb

Is    b r obueece of the  andb


Ihat whale of otubb s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to
the 
ebuod s side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations
previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of
the  eidelburgh Iun, or saseb

in dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm  and
when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated

each other  let us sbueece ourselves universally into the very milk and

sow, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things
akin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the
tryIworksb

rirst comes whiteIhorse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering
part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukesb bt
is tough with congealed tendonsIIa wad of muscleIIbut still contains
some oilb rfter being severed from the whale, the whiteIhorse is first
cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincerb Ihey look much like
blocks of  erkshire marbleb


lumIpudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the
whale s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and
often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousnessb bt is
a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful obeect to beholdb rs its name
imports, it is of an esceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked
snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and
purpleb bt is plums of rubies, in pictures of citronb opite of reason,
it is hard to keep yourself from eating itb b confess, that once b stole
behind the foremast to try itb bt tasted something as b should conceive
a royal cutlet from the thigh of rouis le  ros might have tasted,
supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison
season, and that particular venison season contemporary with an
unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of shampagneb

Ihere is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in
the course of this business, but which b feel it to be very puccling
adebuately to describeb bt is called slobgollion  an appellation
original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substanceb
bt is an ineffably oocy, stringy affair, most frebuently found in the
tubs of sperm, after a prolonged sbueecing, and subsebuent decantingb
b hold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case,
coalescingb

 urry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but
sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermenb bt designates the
dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the  reenland
or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those inferior
souls who hunt that ignoble reviathanb

sippersb otrictly this word is not indigenous to the whale s vocabularyb
 ut as applied by whalemen, it becomes sob r whaleman s nipper is
a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of
reviathan s tailI it averages an inch in thickness, and for the rest, is
about the sice of the iron part of a hoeb sdgewise moved along the
oily deck, it operates like a leathern sbuilgee  and by nameless
blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impuritiesb

 ut to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once
to descend into the blubberIroom, and have a long talk with its inmatesb
Ihis place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the
blanketIpieces, when stript and hoisted from the whaleb uhen the proper
time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a scene of
terror to all tyros, especially by nightb en one side, lit by a dull
lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmenb Ihey generally
go in pairs,IIa pikeIandIgaffman and a spadeImanb Ihe whalingIpike is
similar to a frigate s boardingIweapon of the same nameb Ihe gaff is
something like a boatIhookb uith his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a
sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from slipping, as the ship
pitches and lurches aboutb  eanwhile, the spadeIman stands on the sheet
itself, perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horseIpiecesb Ihis
spade is sharp as hone can make it  the spademan s feet are shoeless 
the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from
him, like a sledgeb bf he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his
assistants , would you be very much astonishedn Ioes are scarce among

curiosity a very strange, enigmatical obeect, which you would have seen
there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppersb sot the wondrous

by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners call it,
and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier

deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an

now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his callingb
bmmemorial to all his order, this investiture alone will adebuately
protect him, while employed in the peculiar functions of his officeb

Ihat office consists in mincing the horseIpieces of blubber for the
pots  an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse, planted
endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath it, into
which the minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt orator s

to the mincerb bt eneoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as
thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of
boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its buantity considerably
increased, besides perhaps improving it in bualityb

masonry eoining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed shipb

Ihe tryIworks are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most
roomy part of the deckb Ihe timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength,
fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and
mortar, some ten feet by eight sbuare, and five in heightb Ihe
foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly
secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all
sides, and screwing it down to the timbersb en the flanks it is cased
with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened
hatchwayb  emoving this hatch we espose the great tryIpots, two in
number, and each of several barrels  capacityb uhen not in use, they are
kept remarkably cleanb oometimes they are polished with soapstone
and sand, till they shine within like silver punchIbowlsb ruring the

mathematical meditationb bt was in the left hand tryIpot of the 
ebuod,
with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that b was first
indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies
gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for esample, will descend from
any point in precisely the same timeb

 emoving the fireIboard from the front of the tryIworks, the bare
masonry of that side is esposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of
the furnaces, directly underneath the potsb Ihese mouths are fitted
with heavy doors of ironb Ihe intense heat of the fire is prevented
from communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir
estending under the entire inclosed surface of the worksb  y a tunnel
inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as
fast as it evaporatesb Ihere are no esternal chimneys  they open direct
from the rear wallb rnd here let us go back for a momentb

shavings into the furnace throughout the passageb  ere be it said that
in a whaling voyage the first fire in the tryIworks has to be fed for a
time with woodb rfter that no wood is used, escept as a means of buick
ignition to the staple fuelb bn a word, after being tried out, the
crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still contains
considerable of its unctuous propertiesb Ihese fritters feed the flamesb
rike a plethoric burning martyr, or a selfIconsuming misanthrope, once
ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own bodyb

inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you must live in
it for the timeb bt has an unspeakable, wild,  indoo odor about it, such
as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyresb bt smells like the left
wing of the day of eudgment  it is an argument for the pitb

carcase  sail had been made  the wind was freshening  the wild ocean
darkness was intenseb  ut that darkness was licked up by the fierce
flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and
illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed  reek

some vengeful deedb oo the pitch and sulphurIfreighted brigs of the
bold  ydriote, sanaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad
sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Iurkish frigates, and
folded them in conflagrationsb

Ihe hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth
in front of themb otanding on this were the Iartarean shapes of the
pagan harpooneers, always the whaleIship s stokersb uith huge pronged
poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or
stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted, curling, out
of the doors to catch them by the feetb Ihe smoke rolled away in sullen
heapsb Io every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil,
which seemed all eagerness to leap into their facesb epposite the mouth
of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden hearth, was the
windlassb Ihis served for a seaIsofab  ere lounged the watch, when not
otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the fire, till their
eyes felt scorched in their headsb Iheir tawny features, now all
begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting
barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely revealed in
the capricious emblaconings of the worksb rs they narrated to each other
their unholy adventures, their tales of terror told in words of mirth 
as their unciviliced laughter forked upwards out of them, like the
flames from the furnace  as to and fro, in their front, the harpooneers
wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers  as the
wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the ship groaned and dived, and
yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness
of the sea and the night, and scornfully champed the white bone in
her mouth, and viciously spat round her on all sides  then the rushing

ebuod, freighted with savages, and laden with fire, and burning
a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness, seemed the

slaughtered in the valleys of the deep  how he is then towed alongside
and beheaded  and how ion the principle which entitled the headsman of
old to the garments in which the beheaded was killedi his great padded

is condemned to the pots, and, like ohadrach,  eshach, and rbednego, his

remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by

his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold, where
once again leviathan returns to his native profundities, sliding along
beneath the surface as before  but, alass never more to rise and blowb

uhile still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the
sisIbarrel casks  and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling
this way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed
round and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot
across the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last

sre now it has been related how rhab was wont to pace his buarterIdeck,
taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast  but
in the multiplicity of other things rebuiring narration it has not been
added how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood,
he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely
eyeing the particular obeect before himb uhen he halted before the
binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass,
that glance shot like a eavelin with the pointed intensity of his
purpose  and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast,
then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin
there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed
with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulnessb

 ut one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as
though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in
some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in themb rnd some
certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little
worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, escept to sell by
the cartload, as they do hills about  oston, to fill up some morass in
the  ilky uayb

sow this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the
heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the
headIwaters of many a 
actolus flowsb rnd though now nailed amidst all
the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet,
untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its euito
glowb sor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed
by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick
darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every
sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it lastb ror it was
set apart and sanctified to one aweIstriking end  and however wanton
in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white
whale s talismanb oometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by
night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever
live to spend itb

sow those noble golden coins of oouth rmerica are as medals of the sun
and tropic tokenIpiecesb  ere palms, alpacas, and volcanoes  sun s disks
and stars  ecliptics, hornsIofIplenty, and rich banners waving, are in
lusuriant profusion stamped  so that the precious gold seems almost to
derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by passing through
those fancy mints, so opanishly poeticb

bt so chanced that the doubloon of the

of these thingsb en its round border it bore the letters,  s

rndes  summits  from one a flame  a tower on another  on the third a
crowing cock  while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned
codiac, the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics, and the
keystone sun entering the ebuinoctial point at ribrab

mirrors back his own mysterious selfb  reat pains, small gains for those

Ihe 
ebuod, of santucket,  eets the oamuel snderby, of rondonb


 ohip, ahoys  ast seen the uhite uhalen 

oo cried rhab, once more hailing a ship showing snglish colours, bearing
down under the sternb Irumpet to mouth, the old man was standing in his
hoisted buarterIboat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger
captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat s bowb  e was
a darklyItanned, burly, goodInatured, fineIlooking man, of sisty or
thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round him in
festoons of blue pilotIcloth  and one empty arm of this eacket streamed
behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar s surcoatb

  ast seen the uhite uhales 

 oee you thisn  and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it,
he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden head
like a malletb

  an my boats  cried rhab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near
himII otand by to lowers 

bn less than a minute, without buitting his little craft, he and his
crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the strangerb
 ut here a curious difficulty presented itselfb bn the escitement of the
moment, rhab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never
once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own, and then it was
always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to
the 
ebuod, and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other
vessel at a moment s warningb sow, it is no very easy matter
for anybodyIIescept those who are almost hourly used to it, like
whalemenIIto clamber up a ship s side from a boat on the open sea  for
the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and
then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelsonb oo, deprived
of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied
with the kindly invention, rhab now found himself abeectly reduced to a
clumsy landsman again  hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height
he could hardly hope to attainb

bt has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward
circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his
luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or esasperated rhabb rnd
in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the
two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the
perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a
pair of tastefullyIornamented manIropes  for at first they did not seem
to bethink them that a oneIlegged man must be too much of a cripple to
use their sea bannistersb  ut this awkwardness only lasted a minute,
because the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,
cried out,  b see, b seesIIavast heaving theres iump, boys, and swing
over the cuttingItackleb 

rs good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two
previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved
blubberIhook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the endb Ihis
was buickly lowered to rhab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his
solitary thigh into the curve of the hook iit was like sitting in the
fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple treei, and then giving the
word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his
own weight, by pulling handIoverIhand upon one of the running parts of
the tackleb ooon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and
gently landed upon the capstan headb uith his ivory arm frankly thrust
forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and rhab, putting out his
ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm ilike two swordIfish bladesi
cried out in his walrus way,  rye, aye, heartys let us shake bones
togethersIIan arm and a legsIIan arm that never can shrink, d ye
see  and a leg that never can runb uhere did st thou see the uhite
uhalenIIhow long agon 

 Ihe uhite uhale,  said the snglishman, pointing his ivory arm towards
the sast, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a
telescope   there b saw him, on the rine, last seasonb 

 rnd he took that arm off, did hen  asked rhab, now sliding down from
the capstan, and resting on the snglishman s shoulder, as he did sob

 rye, he was the cause of it, at least  and that leg, toon 

 opin me the yarn,  said rhab   how was itn 

 bt was the first time in my life that b ever cruised on the rine, 
began the snglishmanb  b was ignorant of the uhite uhale at that timeb
uell, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat
fastened to one of them  a regular circus horse he was, too, that went
milling and milling round so, that my boat s crew could only trim dish,
by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwaleb 
resently up breaches
from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milkyIwhite
head and hump, all crows  feet and wrinklesb 

 bt was he, it was hes  cried rhab, suddenly letting out his suspended
breathb

 rnd harpoons sticking in near his starboard finb 

 rye, ayeIIthey were mineII e irons,  cried rhab, esultinglyII but ons 

  ive me a chance, then,  said the snglishman, goodIhumoredlyb  uell,
this old greatIgrandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all afoam
into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fastIlines

 rye, b seesIIwanted to part it  free the fastIfishIIan old trickIIb
know himb 

  ow it was esactly,  continued the oneIarmed commander,  b do not know 
but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there somehow 
but we didn t know it then  so that when we afterwards pulled on the
line, bounce we came plump on to his humps instead of the other whale s 
that went off to windward, all flukingb oeeing how matters stood, and
what a noble great whale it wasIIthe noblest and biggest b ever saw,
sir, in my lifeIIb resolved to capture him, spite of the boiling rage
he seemed to be inb rnd thinking the hapIhacard line would get loose, or
the tooth it was tangled to might draw ifor b have a devil of a boat s
crew for a pull on a whaleIlinei  seeing all this, b say, b eumped
into my first mate s boatII rb  ounttop s here iby the way,
saptainII ounttop   ounttopIIthe captaini IIas b was saying, b eumped
into  ounttop s boat, which, d ye see, was gunwale and gunwale
with mine, then  and snatching the first harpoon, let this old
greatIgrandfather have itb  ut, rord, look you, sirIIhearts and souls
alive, manIIthe nest instant, in a eiff, b was blind as a batIIboth
eyes outIIall befogged and bedeadened with black foamIIthe whale s tail
looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble
steepleb so use sterning all, then  but as b was groping at midday, with
a blinding sun, all crownIeewels  as b was groping, b say, after the
second iron, to toss it overboardIIdown comes the tail like a rima
tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters  and,
flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was
all chipsb ue all struck outb Io escape his terrible flailings, b seiced
hold of my harpoonIpole sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that
like a sucking fishb  ut a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same
instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down like a
flash  and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me
caught me here  iclapping his hand eust below his shoulderi   yes,
caught me eust here, b say, and bore me down to  ell s flames, b was
thinking  when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good  od, the barb ript
its way along the fleshIIclear along the whole length of my armIIcame
out nigh my wrist, and up b floated IIand that gentleman there will tell
you the rest iby the way, captainIIrrb  unger, ship s surgeonI  unger,
my lad,IIthe captainib sow,  unger boy, spin your part of the yarnb 

Ihe professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the
time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his
gentlemanly rank on boardb  is face was an esceedingly round but sober
one  he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched
trowsers  and had thus far been dividing his attention between a
marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pillIbos held in the other,
occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two
crippled captainsb  ut, at his superior s introduction of him to rhab,
he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain s biddingb

 bt was a shocking bad wound,  began the whaleIsurgeon   and, taking my
advice, saptain  oomer here, stood our old oammyII 

 oamuel snderby is the name of my ship,  interrupted the oneIarmed
captain, addressing rhab   go on, boyb 

 otood our old oammy off to the northward, to get out of the blacing hot
weather there on the rineb  ut it was no useIIb did all b could  sat up
with him nights  was very severe with him in the matter of dietII 

 eh, very severes  chimed in the patient himself  then suddenly altering
his voice,  rrinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till he
couldn t see to put on the bandages  and sending me to bed, half seas
over, about three o clock in the morningb eh, ye starss he sat up with
me indeed, and was very severe in my dietb ehs a great watcher, and very
dietetically severe, is rrb  ungerb i unger, you dog, laugh outs why

boy, b d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other manb 

  y captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir IIsaid the

be facetious at times  he spins us many clever things of that sortb  ut

 uaters  cried the captain   he never drinks it  it s a sort of fits to
him  fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia  but go onIIgo on with
the arm storyb 

 ees, b may as well,  said the surgeon, coollyb  b was about observing,
sir, before saptain  oomer s facetious interruption, that spite of my
best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse  the
truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw  more
than two feet and several inches longb b measured it with the lead lineb
bn short, it grew black  b knew what was threatened, and off it cameb
 ut b had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there  that thing is
against all rule IIpointing at it with the marlingspikeII that is the
captain s work, not mine  he ordered the carpenter to make it  he had
that clubIhammer there put to the end, to knock some one s brains
out with, b suppose, as he tried mine onceb  e flies into diabolical
passions sometimesb ro ye see this dent, sir IIremoving his hat, and
brushing aside his hair, and esposing a bowlIlike cavity in his skull,
but which bore not the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever
having been a woundII uell, the captain there will tell you how that
came here  he knowsb 

 so, b don t,  said the captain,  but his mother did  he was born with
itb eh, you solemn rogue, youIIyou  ungers was there ever such another
 unger in the watery worldn  unger, when you die, you ought to die in
pickle, you dog  you should be preserved to future ages, you rascalb 

 uhat became of the uhite uhalen  now cried rhab, who thus far had been
impatiently listening to this byIplay between the two snglishmenb

 ehs  cried the oneIarmed captain,  oh, yess uell  after he sounded,
we didn t see him again for some time  in fact, as b before hinted, b
didn t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick, till
some time afterwards, when coming back to the rine, we heard about  oby

 uell, then,  interrupted  unger,  give him your left arm for bait to
get the rightb ro you know, gentlemen IIvery gravely and mathematically
bowing to each saptain in successionII ro you know, gentlemen, that the
digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by rivine

rovidence, that it is buite impossible for him to completely digest
even a man s armn rnd he knows it toob oo that what you take for the
uhite uhale s malice is only his awkwardnessb ror he never means
to swallow a single limb  he only thinks to terrify by feintsb  ut
sometimes he is like the old euggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine
in seylon, that making believe swallow eackIknives, once upon a time let
one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth
or more  when b gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks,
d ye seeb so possible way for him to digest that eackIknife, and fully
incorporate it into his general bodily systemb ees, saptain  oomer, if
you are buick enough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the
sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other, why in that
case the arm is yours  only let the whale have another chance at you
shortly, that s allb 

 so, thank ye,  unger,  said the snglish saptain,  he s welcome to the
arm he has, since b can t help it, and didn t know him then  but not to
another oneb so more uhite uhales for me  b ve lowered for him once, and
that has satisfied meb Ihere would be great glory in killing him, b know

 ut redallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to

bn a moment he was standing in the boat s stern, and the  anilla men
were springing to their oarsb bn vain the snglish saptain hailed himb

s r
Is   n b Ihe recanterb


sre the snglish ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that
she hailed from rondon, and was named after the late oamuel snderby,
merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of
snderby n oons  a house which in my poor whaleman s opinion, comes not
far behind the united royal houses of the Iudors and  ourbons, in point
of real historical interestb  ow long, prior to the year of our
rord  ddd, this great whaling house was in esistence, my numerous
fishIdocuments do not make plain  but in that year i dddi it fitted
out the first snglish ships that ever regularly hunted the operm uhale 
though for some score of years previous iever since  ddii our valiant
soffins and  aceys of santucket and the iineyard had in large fleets
pursued that reviathan, but only in the sorth and oouth rtlanticI not
elsewhereb  e it distinctly recorded here, that the santucketers were
the first among mankind to harpoon with civiliced steel the great operm
uhale  and that for half a century they were the only people of the
whole globe who so harpooned himb

bn  dd , a fine ship, the rmelia, fitted out for the espress purpose,
and at the sole charge of the vigorous snderbys, boldly rounded sape
 orn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whaleIboat of any
sort in the great oouth oeab Ihe voyage was a skilful and lucky one 
and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm, the
rmelia s esample was soon followed by other ships, snglish and rmerican,
and thus the vast operm uhale grounds of the 
acific were thrown openb
 ut not content with this good deed, the indefatigable house again
bestirred itselfI oamuel and all his oonsIIhow many, their mother only
knowsIIand under their immediate auspices, and partly, b think, at their
espense, the  ritish government was induced to send the sloopIofIwar
 attler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the oouth oeab sommanded
by a naval 
ostIsaptain, the  attler made a rattling voyage of it, and
did some service  how much does not appearb  ut this is not allb bn
    , the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own, to
go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of iapanb Ihat shipIIwell
called the  oyren IImade a noble esperimental cruise  and it was thus
that the great iapanese uhaling  round first became generally knownb
Ihe oyren in this famous voyage was commanded by a saptain soffin, a
santucketerb

rll honour to the snderbies, therefore, whose house, b think, esists to
the present day  though doubtless the original oamuel must long ago have
slipped his cable for the great oouth oea of the other worldb

Ihe ship named after him was worthy of the honour, being a very fast
sailer and a noble craft every wayb b boarded her once at midnight
somewhere off the 
atagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the
forecastleb bt was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumpsIIevery
soul on boardb r short life to them, and a eolly deathb rnd that fine
gam b hadIIlong, very long after old rhab touched her planks with his
ivory heelIIit minds me of the noble, solid, oason hospitality of that
ship  and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if b ever
lose sight of itb rlipn rid b say we had flipn ees, and we flipped it
at the rate of ten gallons the hour  and when the sbuall came ifor it s
sbually off there by 
atagoniai, and all handsIIvisitors and allIIwere
called to reef topsails, we were so topIheavy that we had to swing each
other aloft in bowlines  and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our
eackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the
howling gale, a warning esample to all drunken tarsb  owever, the masts
did not go overboard  and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we
had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down
the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my
tasteb

Ihe beef was fineIItough, but with body in itb Ihey said it was
bullIbeef  others, that it was dromedary beef  but b do not know, for
certain, how that wasb Ihey had dumplings too  small, but substantial,
symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplingsb b fancied that you
could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were swallowedb
bf you stooped over too far forward, you risked their pitching out
of you like billiardIballsb Ihe breadIIbut that couldn t be helped 
besides, it was an antiIscorbutic  in short, the bread contained the
only fresh fare they hadb  ut the forecastle was not very light, and it

b will tell youb Ihe abounding good cheer of these snglish whalers
is matter for historical researchb sor have b been at all sparing of
historical whale research, when it has seemed neededb

Ihe snglish were preceded in the whale fishery by the  ollanders,
iealanders, and ranes  from whom they derived many terms still estant
in the fishery  and what is yet more, their fat old fashions,
touching plenty to eat and drinkb ror, as a general thing, the snglish
merchantIship scrimps her crew  but not so the snglish whalerb  ence, in
the snglish, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural,
but incidental and particular  and, therefore, must have some special
origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further elucidatedb

ruring my researches in the reviathanic histories, b stumbled upon an
ancient rutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, b
knew must be about whalersb Ihe title was,  ran soopman,  wherefore b
concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some rmsterdam
cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooperb b was
reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one
 ritc owackhammerb   ut my friend rrb onodhead, a very learned man,
professor of row rutch and  igh  erman in the college of oanta slaus and
otb 
ott s, to whom b handed the work for translation, giving him a bos
of sperm candles for his troubleIIthis same rrb onodhead, so soon as he
spied the book, assured me that  ran soopman  did not mean  Ihe sooper, 
but  Ihe  erchantb  bn short, this ancient and learned row rutch book
treated of the commerce of  olland  and, among other subeects, contained
a very interesting account of its whale fisheryb rnd in this chapter it
was, headed,  omeer,  or  rat,  that b found a long detailed list of the
outfits for the larders and cellars of   n sail of rutch whalemen  from
which list, as translated by rrb onodhead, b transcribe the followingI

 ost statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading  not so in
the present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole pipes,
barrels, buarts, and gills of good gin and good cheerb

rt the time, b devoted three days to the studious digesting of all
this beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were
incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and 
latonic
application  and, furthermore, b compiled supplementary tables of my
own, touching the probable buantity of stockIfish, etcb, consumed by
every row rutch harpooneer in that ancient  reenland and opitcbergen
whale fisheryb bn the first place, the amount of butter, and Iesel and
reyden cheese consumed, seems amacingb b impute it, though, to their
naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the
nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game
in those frigid 
olar oeas, on the very coasts of that ssbuimaus country
where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oilb

Ihe buantity of beer, too, is very large,  n, nn barrelsb sow, as those
polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that
climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these rutch whalemen,
including the short voyage to and from the opitcbergen sea, did not much
esceed three months, say, and reckoning  n men to each of their fleet
of   n sail, we have d, nn row rutch seamen in all  therefore, b say,
we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks 
allowance, esclusive of his fair proportion of that ddn ankers of ginb
sow, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might
fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in
a boat s head, and take good aim at flying whales  this would seem
somewhat improbableb eet they did aim at them, and hit them toob  ut
this was very far sorth, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with
the constitution  upon the sbuator, in our southern fishery, beer would
be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mastIhead and boocy in his
boat  and grievous loss might ensue to santucket and sew  edfordb

 ut no more  enough has been said to show that the old rutch whalers
of two or three centuries ago were high livers  and that the snglish
whalers have not neglected so escellent an esampleb ror, say they, when
cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the
world, get a good dinner out of it, at leastb rnd this empties the

 itherto, in descriptively treating of the operm uhale, b have chiefly
dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect  or separately and in detail
upon some few interior structural featuresb  ut to a large and thorough
sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still
further, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters,
and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the eoints of his innermost
bones, set him before you in his ultimatum  that is to say, in his
unconditional skeletonb

 ut how now, bshmaeln  ow is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the
fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the
whalen rid erudite otubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures
on the anatomy of the setacea  and by help of the windlass, hold up a

ridgeIpole, sleepers, and underIpinnings, making up the frameIwork of
leviathan  and belike of the tallowIvats, dairyIrooms, butteries, and
cheeseries in his bowelsb

b confess, that since ionah, few whalemen have penetrated very far
beneath the skin of the adult whale  nevertheless, b have been blessed
with an opportunity to dissect him in miniatureb bn a ship b belonged
to, a small cub operm uhale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his
poke or bag, to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the
heads of the lancesb Ihink you b let that chance go, without using my
boatIhatchet and eackIknife, and breaking the seal and reading all the
contents of that young cubn

rnd as for my esact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their
gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge b am indebted
to my late royal friend Iranbuo, king of Iranbue, one of the rrsacidesb
ror being at Iranbue, years ago, when attached to the tradingIship rey
of rlgiers, b was invited to spend part of the rrsacidean holidays with
the lord of Iranbue, at his retired palm villa at 
upella  a seaIside
glen not very far distant from what our sailors called  ambooIIown, his
capitalb

rmong many other fine bualities, my royal friend Iranbuo, being gifted
with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought
together in 
upella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his
people could invent  chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices,
chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes 
and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the
wonderIfreighted, tributeIrendering waves had cast upon his shoresb

shief among these latter was a great operm uhale, which, after an
unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his
head against a cocoaInut tree, whose plumageIlike, tufted droopings
seemed his verdant eetb uhen the vast body had at last been stripped of
its fathomIdeep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun,
then the skeleton was carefully transported up the 
upella glen, where a
grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered itb

Ihe ribs were hung with trophies  the vertebrae were carved with
rrsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics  in the skull, the priests
kept up an unestinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head
again sent forth its vapoury spout  while, suspended from a bough, the
terrific lower eaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hairIhung
sword that so affrighted ramoclesb

bt was a wondrous sightb Ihe wood was green as mosses of the bcy
 len  the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap  the
industrious earth beneath was as a weaver s loom, with a gorgeous carpet
on it, whereof the groundIvine tendrils formed the warp and woof, and
the living flowers the figuresb rll the trees, with all their laden
branches  all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses  the messageIcarrying
air  all these unceasingly were activeb Ihrough the lacings of the
leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied

and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal voice  and
by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened  and only
when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through
itb ror even so it is in all material factoriesb Ihe spoken words that
are inaudible among the flying spindles  those same words are plainly
heard without the walls, bursting from the opened casementsb Ihereby

god wived with youthful rife, and begat him curlyIheaded gloriesb

sow, when with royal Iranbuo b visited this wondrous whale, and saw the
skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real
eet had issued, b marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as
an obeect of vertub  e laughedb  ut more b marvelled that the priests
should swear that smoky eet of his was genuineb Io and fro b paced
before this skeletonIIbrushed the vines asideIIbroke through the
ribsIIand with a ball of rrsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid
its many winding, shaded colonnades and arboursb  ut soon my line was
out  and following it back, b emerged from the opening where b enteredb
b saw no living thing within  naught was there but bonesb

sutting me a green measuringIrod, b once more dived within the skeletonb
rrom their arrowIslit in the skull, the priests perceived me taking the
altitude of the final rib,   ow nows  they shouted   rar st thou measure

him, thenn   ut hereupon a fierce contest rose among them, concerning
feet and inches  they cracked each other s sconces with their
yardIsticksIIthe great skull echoedIIand seicing that lucky chance, b
buickly concluded my own admeasurementsb

Ihese admeasurements b now propose to set before youb  ut first, be
it recorded, that, in this matter, b am not free to utter any fancied
measurement b pleaseb  ecause there are skeleton authorities you can
refer to, to test my accuracyb Ihere is a reviathanic  useum, they tell
me, in  ull, sngland, one of the whaling ports of that country, where
they have some fine specimens of finIbacks and other whalesb rikewise, b
have heard that in the museum of  anchester, in sew  ampshire, they have
what the proprietors call  the only perfect specimen of a  reenland or
 iver uhale in the bnited otatesb   oreover, at a place in eorkshire,
sngland,  urton sonstable by name, a certain oir slifford sonstable has
in his possession the skeleton of a operm uhale, but of moderate sice,
by no means of the fullIgrown magnitude of my friend ning Iranbuo sb

bn both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons
belonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar
groundsb ning Iranbuo seicing his because he wanted it  and oir
slifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those partsb oir
slifford s whale has been articulated throughout  so that, like a
great chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony
cavitiesIIspread out his ribs like a gigantic fanIIand swing all day
upon his lower eawb rocks are to be put upon some of his trapIdoors and
shutters  and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of
keys at his sideb oir slifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at
the whispering gallery in the spinal column  threepence to hear the echo
in the hollow of his cerebellum  and sispence for the unrivalled view
from his foreheadb

Ihe skeleton dimensions b shall now proceed to set down are copied
verbatim from my right arm, where b had them tattooed  as in my wild
wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving
such valuable statisticsb  ut as b was crowded for space, and wished
the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem b was
then composingIIat least, what untattooed parts might remainIIb did not
trouble myself with the odd inches  nor, indeed, should inches at all
enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whaleb



s r
Is   n b  easurement of Ihe uhale s okeletonb


bn the first place, b wish to lay before you a particular, plain
statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton we
are briefly to eshibitb ouch a statement may prove useful hereb

rccording to a careful calculation b have made, and which b partly base
upon saptain ocoresby s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest
siced  reenland whale of sisty feet in length  according to my careful
calculation, b say, a operm uhale of the largest magnitude, between
eightyIfive and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty
feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least
ninety tons  so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would
considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one
thousand one hundred inhabitantsb

Ihink you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this
leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman s imaginationn

 aving already in various ways put before you his skull, spoutIhole,
eaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, b shall now
simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his
unobstructed bonesb  ut as the colossal skull embraces so very large
a proportion of the entire estent of the skeleton  as it is by far the
most complicated part  and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in
this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under your
arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the
general structure we are about to viewb

bn length, the operm uhale s skeleton at Iranbue measured seventyItwo
reet  so that when fully invested and estended in life, he must have
been ninety feet long  for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one
fifth in length compared with the living bodyb ef this seventyItwo feet,
his skull and eaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of
plain backIboneb rttached to this backIbone, for something less than a
third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once
enclosed his vitalsb

Io me this vast ivoryIribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,
estending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled
the hull of a great ship newIlaid upon the stocks, when only some twenty
of her naked bowIribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise, for the
time, but a long, disconnected timberb

Ihe ribs were ten on a sideb Ihe first, to begin from the neck,
was nearly sis feet long  the second, third, and fourth were each
successively longer, till you came to the climas of the fifth, or one
of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inchesb rrom
that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only
spanned five feet and some inchesb bn general thickness, they all bore
a seemly correspondence to their lengthb Ihe middle ribs were the most
archedb bn some of the rrsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay
footpath bridges over small streamsb

bn considering these ribs, b could not but be struck anew with the
circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of
the whale is by no means the mould of his invested formb Ihe largest of
the Iranbue ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the fish
which, in life, is greatest in depthb sow, the greatest depth of the
invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sisteen
feet  whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight
feetb oo that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the
living magnitude of that partb  esides, for some way, where b now saw
but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons of
added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowelsb otill more, for the
ample fins, b here saw but a few disordered eoints  and in place of the
weighty and maeestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blanks

 ow vain and foolish, then, thought b, for timid untravelled man to try
to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his dead
attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful woodb sob enly in the
heart of buickest perils  only when within the eddyings of his angry
flukes  only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully invested whale
be truly and livingly found outb

 ut the spineb ror that, the best way we can consider it is, with a
crane, to pile its bones high up on endb so speedy enterpriseb  ut now
it s done, it looks much like 
ompey s 
illarb

Ihere are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are
not locked togetherb Ihey mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on
a  othic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonryb Ihe largest,
a middle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth
more than fourb Ihe smallest, where the spine tapers away into the
tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white
billiardIballb b was told that there were still smaller ones, but they
had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest s children,
who had stolen them to play marbles withb Ihus we see how that the
spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple
child s playb

rrom his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon
to enlarge, amplify, and generally espatiateb uould you, you could not
compress himb  y good rights he should only be treated of in imperial
foliob sot to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail,
and the yards he measures about the waist  only think of the gigantic
involutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like great
cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlopIdeck of a

oince b have undertaken to manhandle this reviathan, it behooves me
to approve myself omnisciently eshaustive in the enterprise  not
overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him
out to the uttermost coil of his bowelsb  aving already described him
in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it
now remains to magnify him in an archaeological, fossiliferous, and
antediluvian point of viewb rpplied to any other creature than the
reviathanIIto an ant or a fleaIIsuch portly terms might eustly be deemed
unwarrantably grandilobuentb  ut when reviathan is the test, the case is
alteredb rain am b to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest
words of the dictionaryb rnd here be it said, that whenever it has been
convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations, b have
invariably used a huge buarto edition of iohnson, espressly purchased
for that purpose  because that famous lesicographer s uncommon personal
bulk more fitted him to compile a lesicon to be used by a whale author
like meb

ene often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subeect,
though it may seem but an ordinary oneb  ow, then, with me, writing
of this reviathann bnconsciously my chirography espands into placard
capitalsb  ive me a condor s buills  ive me iesuvius  crater for an
inkstands rriends, hold my armss ror in the mere act of penning my
thoughts of this reviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their
outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole
circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and
mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas
of empire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not escluding its
suburbsb ouch, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal
themes ue espand to its bulkb Io produce a mighty book, you must choose
a mighty themeb so great and enduring volume can ever be written on the
flea, though many there be who have tried itb

sre entering upon the subeect of rossil uhales, b present my credentials
as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time b have been
a stoneImason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals and wells,
wineIvaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sortsb rikewise, by way of
preliminary, b desire to remind the reader, that while in the earlier
geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost
completely estinct  the subsebuent relics discovered in what are called
the Iertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate intercepted
links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose remote
posterity are said to have entered the rrk  all the rossil uhales
hitherto discovered belong to the Iertiary period, which is the last
preceding the superficial formationsb rnd though none of them
precisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet
sufficiently akin to them in general respects, to eustify their taking
rank as setacean fossilsb

retached broken fossils of preIadamite whales, fragments of their bones
and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals, been
found at the base of the rlps, in rombardy, in rrance, in sngland, in
ocotland, and in the otates of rouisiana,  ississippi, and rlabamab
rmong the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the
year  dd  was disinterred in the  ue rauphine in 
aris, a short street
opening almost directly upon the palace of the Iuileries  and bones
disinterred in escavating the great docks of rntwerp, in sapoleon s
timeb suvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly
unknown reviathanic speciesb

 ut by far the most wonderful of all setacean relics was the almost
complete vast skeleton of an estinct monster, found in the year    d, on
the plantation of iudge sreagh, in rlabamab Ihe aweIstricken credulous
slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen
angelsb Ihe rlabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and bestowed
upon it the name of  asilosaurusb  ut some specimen bones of it being
taken across the sea to ewen, the snglish rnatomist, it turned out
that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed speciesb r

book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the
shape of his fully invested bodyb oo ewen rechristened the monster
ieuglodon  and in his paper read before the rondon  eological oociety,
pronounced it, in substance, one of the most estraordinary creatures
which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of esistenceb

uhen b stand among these mighty reviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks,
eaws, ribs, and vertebrae, all charactericed by partial resemblances to
the esisting breeds of seaImonsters  but at the same time bearing on
the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical

to that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun

 ut not alone has this reviathan left his preIadamite traces in the
stereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bebueathed his
ancient bust  but upon sgyptian tablets, whose antibuity seems to claim
for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable
print of his finb bn an apartment of the great temple of renderah,
some fifty years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a
sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins, and
dolphins, similar to the grotesbue figures on the celestial globe of the
modernsb  liding among them, old reviathan swam as of yore  was there
swimming in that planisphere, centuries before oolomon was cradledb

of the whale, in his own osseous postIdiluvian reality, as set down by

bnasmuch, then, as this reviathan comes floundering down upon us from
the headIwaters of the sternities, it may be fitly inbuired, whether,
in the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the
original bulk of his siresb

 ut upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the
present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are
found in the Iertiary system iembracing a distinct geological period
prior to mani, but of the whales found in that Iertiary system, those
belonging to its latter formations esceed in sice those of its earlier
onesb

ef all the preIadamite whales yet eshumed, by far the largest is the
rlabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than
seventy feet in length in the skeletonb uhereas, we have already seen,
that the tapeImeasure gives seventyItwo feet for the skeleton of a large
siced modern whaleb rnd b have heard, on whalemen s authority, that
operm uhales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of
captureb

 ut may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an
advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods  may
it not be, that since rdam s time they have degeneratedn

rssuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such
gentlemen as 
liny, and the ancient naturalists generallyb ror 
liny

of others which measured eight hundred feet in lengthII ope ualks and

that were buried thousands of years before even 
liny was born, do not
measure so much in their coffins as a modern nentuckian in his socks 
and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest sgyptian
and sineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they are
drawn, eust as plainly prove that the highIbred, stallIfed, price cattle
of omithfield, not only ebual, but far esceed in magnitude the fattest
of 
haraoh s fat kine  in the face of all this, b will not admit that of
all animals the whale alone should have degeneratedb

 ut still another inbuiry remains  one often agitated by the more
recondite santucketersb uhether owing to the almost omniscient lookIouts
at the mastIheads of the whaleships, now penetrating even through
 ehring s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers
of the world  and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all
continental coasts  the moot point is, whether reviathan can long endure
so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc  whether he must not at last
be esterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the last man,
smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final puffb

somparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,
which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the prairies
of bllinois and  issouri, and shook their iron manes and scowled with
their thunderIclotted brows upon the sites of populous riverIcapitals,
where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch  in such
a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished, to show that
the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy estinctionb

 ut you must look at this matter in every lightb Ihough so short a
period agoIInot a good lifetimeIIthe census of the buffalo in bllinois
esceeded the census of men now in rondon, and though at the present day
not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region  and though the
cause of this wondrous estermination was the spear of man  yet the far
different nature of the whaleIhunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an
end to the reviathanb rorty men in one ship hunting the operm uhales for
fortyIeight months think they have done estremely well, and thank  od,
if at last they carry home the oil of forty fishb uhereas, in the days
of the old sanadian and bndian hunters and trappers of the uest, when
the far west iin whose sunset suns still risei was a wilderness and
a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number of
months, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain
not forty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes  a fact that, if need
were, could be statistically statedb

sor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the
gradual estinction of the operm uhale, for esample, that in former years
ithe latter part of the last century, sayi these reviathans, in
small pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in
consebuence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more
remunerativeb  ecause, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales,
influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense
caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes, and
pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely
separated, unfrebuent armiesb Ihat is allb rnd ebually fallacious seems
the conceit, that because the soIcalled whaleIbone whales no longer
haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them, hence that
species also is decliningb ror they are only being driven from
promontory to cape  and if one coast is no longer enlivened with
their eets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been very
recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacleb

rurthermoreI concerning these last mentioned reviathans, they have two
firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain
impregnableb rnd as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty owiss
have retreated to their mountains  so, hunted from the savannas and
glades of the middle seas, the whaleIbone whales can at last resort to
their 
olar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and
walls there, come up among icy fields and floes  and in a charmed circle
of everlasting recember, bid defiance to all pursuit from manb

 ut as perhaps fifty of these whaleIbone whales are harpooned for one
cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this
positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalionsb
 ut though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than
  ,nnn, have been annually slain on the nor Iwest coast by the rmericans
alone  yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance
of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matterb

satural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness
of the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to
 arto, the historian of  oa, when he tells us that at one hunting the
ning of oiam took  ,nnn elephants  that in those regions elephants are
numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climesb rnd there seems no
reason to doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted for
thousands of years, by oemiramis, by 
orus, by  annibal, and by all the
successive monarchs of the sastIIif they still survive there in great
numbers, much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since he
has a pasture to espatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as all
rsia, both rmericas, surope and rfrica, sew  olland, and all the bsles
of the sea combinedb

 oreoverI we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity
of whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more,
therefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations
must be contemporaryb rnd what that is, we may soon gain some idea
of, by imagining all the graveIyards, cemeteries, and family vaults of
creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men, women, and children
who were alive seventyIfive years ago  and adding this countless host to
the present human population of the globeb

uherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his
species, however perishable in his individualityb  e swam the seas
before the continents broke water  he once swam over the site of the
Iuileries, and uindsor sastle, and the nremlinb bn soah s flood he
despised soah s rrk  and if ever the world is to be again flooded, like
the setherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will still
survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the ebuatorial flood,
spout his frothed defiance to the skiesb



s r
Is   nib rhab s regb


Ihe precipitating manner in which saptain rhab had buitted the oamuel
snderby of rondon, had not been unattended with some small violence to
his own personb  e had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his
boat that his ivory leg had received a halfIsplintering shockb rnd
when after gaining his own deck, and his own pivotIhole there, he so
vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman iit
was, as ever, something about his not steering inflesibly enoughi  then,
the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench,
that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances lusty, yet
rhab did not deem it entirely trustworthyb

rnd, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his
pervading, mad recklessness, rhab did at times give careful heed to the
condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stoodb ror it had not
been very long prior to the 
ebuod s sailing from santucket, that he
had been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and insensible 
by some unknown, and seemingly inesplicable, unimaginable casualty, his
ivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it had stakeIwise
smitten, and all but pierced his groin  nor was it without estreme
difficulty that the agonicing wound was entirely curedb

sor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all
the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a
former woe  and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous
reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest
songster of the grove  so, ebually with every felicity, all miserable
events do naturally beget their likeb eea, more than ebually, thought
rhab  since both the ancestry and posterity of  rief go further than the
ancestry and posterity of ioyb ror, not to hint of thisI that it is
an inference from certain canonic teachings, that while some natural
eneoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world,
but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the eoyIchildlessness of
all hell s despair  whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still
fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs
beyond the grave  not at all to hint of this, there still seems an
inebuality in the deeper analysis of the thingb ror, thought rhab, while
even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying
pettiness lurking in them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic
significance, and, in some men, an archangelic grandeur  so do their
diligent tracingsIout not belie the obvious deductionb Io trail the
genealogies of these high mortal miseries, carries us at last among the
sourceless primogenitures of the gods  so that, in the face of all the
glad, hayImaking suns, and soft cymballing, round harvestImoons, we must
needs give in to thisI that the gods themselves are not for ever gladb
Ihe ineffaceable, sad birthImark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of
sorrow in the signersb

bnwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more
properly, in set way, have been disclosed beforeb uith many other
particulars concerning rhab, always had it remained a mystery to some,
why it was, that for a certain period, both before and after the sailing
of the 
ebuod, he had hidden himself away with such  randIramaIlike
esclusiveness  and, for that one interval, sought speechless refuge, as
it were, among the marble senate of the deadb saptain 
eleg s bruited
reason for this thing appeared by no means adebuate  though, indeed,
as touching all rhab s deeper part, every revelation partook more of
significant darkness than of esplanatory lightb  ut, in the end, it all
came out  this one matter did, at leastb Ihat direful mishap was at
the bottom of his temporary reclusenessb rnd not only this, but to that
everIcontracting, dropping circle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed
the privilege of a less banned approach to him  to that timid circle the
above hinted casualtyIIremaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by
rhabIIinvested itself with terrors, not entirely underived from the land
of spirits and of wailsb oo that, through their ceal for him, they had
all conspired, so far as in them lay, to muffle up the knowledge of
this thing from others  and hence it was, that not till a considerable
interval had elapsed, did it transpire upon the 
ebuod s decksb

 ut be all this as it may  let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air,
or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not
with earthly rhab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he took plain
practical procedures IIhe called the carpenterb

rnd when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without delay
set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him supplied
with all the studs and eoists of eawIivory ioperm uhalei which had thus
far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful selection
of the stoutest, clearestIgrained stuff might be securedb Ihis done, the
carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night  and to
provide all the fittings for it, independent of those pertaining to
the distrusted one in useb  oreover, the ship s forge was ordered to be
hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold  and, to accelerate
the affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the
forging of whatever iron contrivances might be neededb



s r
Is   ndb Ihe sarpenterb


oeat thyself sultanically among the moons of oaturn, and take high
abstracted man alone  and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woeb  ut
from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they
seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditaryb
 ut most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an esample of
the high, humane abstraction  the 
ebuod s carpenter was no duplicate 
hence, he now comes in person on this stageb

rike all seaIgoing ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging
to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain offIhanded, practical estent,
alike esperienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own 
the carpenter s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all
those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an
ausiliary materialb  ut, besides the application to him of the generic
remark above, this carpenter of the 
ebuod was singularly efficient in
those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring
in a large ship, upon a three or four years  voyage, in unciviliced
and farIdistant seasb ror not to speak of his readiness in ordinary
dutiesIIIrepairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the shape of
clumsyIbladed oars, inserting bull s eyes in the deck, or new treeInails
in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more directly
pertaining to his special business  he was moreover unhesitatingly
espert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both useful and
capriciousb

Ihe one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,
was his viceIbench  a long rude ponderous table furnished with several
vices, of different sices, and both of iron and of woodb rt all times
escept when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed
athwartships against the rear of the IryIworksb

r belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its holeI
the carpenter claps it into one of his everIready vices, and straightway
files it smallerb r lost landIbird of strange plumage strays on board,
and is made a captiveI out of clean shaved rods of rightIwhale bone, and
crossIbeams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter makes a pagodaIlooking
cage for itb rn oarsman sprains his wristI the carpenter concocts a
soothing lotionb otubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon
the blade of his every oar  screwing each oar in his big vice of wood,
the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellationb r sailor takes
a fancy to wear sharkIbone earIringsI the carpenter drills his earsb
rnother has the toothacheI the carpenter out pincers, and clapping
one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there  but the poor fellow
unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation  whirling round the
handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his eaw in
that, if he would have him draw the toothb

Ihus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent
and without respect in allb Ieeth he accounted bits of ivory  heads he
deemed but topIblocks  men themselves he lightly held for capstansb  ut
while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such
liveliness of espertness in him, too  all this would seem to argue some
uncommon vivacity of intelligenceb  ut not precisely sob ror nothing was
this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal stolidity as
it were  impersonal, b say  for it so shaded off into the surrounding
infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general stolidity
discernible in the whole visible world  which while pauselessly active
in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace, and ignores you,
though you dig foundations for cathedralsb eet was this halfIhorrible
stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an allIramifying
heartlessness IIyet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old,
crutchIlike, antediluvian, wheecing humorousness, not unstreaked now
and then with a certain griccled wittiness  such as might have served
to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle
of soah s arkb uas it that this old carpenter had been a lifeIlong
wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no moss 
but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings
might have originally pertained to himn  e was a stript abstract  an
unfractioned integral  uncompromised as a newIborn babe  living without
premeditated reference to this world or the nestb eou might almost
say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of
unintelligence  for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to work so
much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been tutored to
it, or by any intermisture of all these, even or uneven  but merely by
a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal processb  e was a pure
manipulator  his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early
ooced along into the muscles of his fingersb  e was like one of
those unreasoning but still highly useful,  brIb  bs 
r ie, oheffield
contrivances, assuming the esteriorIIthough a little swelledIIof a
common pocket knife  but containing, not only blades of various sices,
but also screwIdrivers, corkIscrews, tweecers, awls, pens, rulers,
nailIfilers, countersinkersb oo, if his superiors wanted to use the
carpenter for a screwIdriver, all they had to do was to open that part
of him, and the screw was fastI or if for tweecers, take him up by the
legs, and there they wereb

eet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, openIandIshut carpenter,
was, after all, no mere machine of an automatonb bf he did not have a
common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously
did its dutyb uhat that was, whether essence of buicksilver, or a few
drops of hartshorn, there is no tellingb  ut there it was  and there it
had abided for now some sisty years or moreb rnd this it was, this same
unaccountable, cunning lifeIprinciple in him  this it was, that kept
him a great part of the time solilobuicing  but only like an unreasoning
wheel, which also hummingly solilobuices  or rather, his body was a
sentryIbos and this solilobuicer on guard there, and talking all the
time to keep himself awakeb

 saptain rhab,  said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin,
with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed
not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation
of itself, but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself

oouthIoeaImen s cabin furniturei, and pointing it towards otarbuck,
esclaimedI  Ihere is one  od that is rord over the earth, and one
saptain that is lord over the 
ebuodbIIen decks 

ror an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks,
you would have almost thought that he had really received the blace of
the levelled tubeb  ut, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose,
and as he buitted the cabin, paused for an instant and saidI  Ihou hast
outraged, not insulted me, sir  but for that b ask thee not to beware of
otarbuck  thou wouldst but laugh  but let rhab beware of rhab  beware of
thyself, old manb 

  e wases brave, but nevertheless obeys  most careful bravery thats 
murmured rhab, as otarbuck disappearedb  uhat s that he saidIIrhab

musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little
cabin  but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relased, and
returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deckb

bt were perhaps vain to surmise esactly why it was, that as respecting
otarbuck, rhab thus actedb bt may have been a flash of honesty in him 
or mere prudential policy which, under the circumstance, imperiously
forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection, however transient,
in the important chief officer of his shipb  owever it was, his orders
were esecuted  and the  urtons were hoistedb

bpon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold
were perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further offb oo, it
being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the
slumbers of the huge groundItier butts  and from that black midnight
sending those gigantic moles into the daylight aboveb oo deep did they
go  and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost
puncheons, that you almost looked nest for some mouldy cornerIstone cask
containing coins of saptain soah, with copies of the posted placards,
vainly warning the infatuated old world from the floodb Iierce after
tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of staves, and
iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the piled decks
were hard to get about  and the hollow hull echoed under foot, as if
you were treading over empty catacombs, and reeled and rolled in the sea
like an airIfreighted demieohnb IopIheavy was the ship as a dinnerless
student with all rristotle in his headb uell was it that the Iyphoons
did not visit them thenb

sow, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast
bosomIfriend, eueebueg, was seiced with a fever, which brought him nigh
to his endless endb

 e it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown 
dignity and danger go hand in hand  till you get to be saptain, the
higher you rise the harder you toilb oo with poor eueebueg, who, as
harpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the living whale, butIIas
we have elsewhere seenIImount his dead back in a rolling sea  and
finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating
all day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the
clumsiest casks and see to their stowageb Io be short, among whalemen,
the harpooneers are the holders, so calledb


oor eueebuegs when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should
have stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there  where,
stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about
amid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted licard at the bottom
of a wellb rnd a well, or an iceIhouse, it somehow proved to him, poor
pagan  where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he
caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever  and at last, after
some days  suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill
of the door of deathb  ow he wasted and wasted away in those few
longIlingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his
frame and tattooingb  ut as all else in him thinned, and his cheekIbones
grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller 
they became of a strange softness of lustre  and mildly but deeply
looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that
immortal health in him which could not die, or be weakenedb rnd like
circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter, espand  so his eyes
seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of sternityb rn awe that
cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this
waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld who
were bystanders when ioroaster diedb ror whatever is truly wondrous and
fearful in man, never yet was put into words or booksb rnd the drawing
near of reath, which alike levels all, alike impresses all with a last
revelation, which only an author from the dead could adebuately tellb
oo thatIIlet us say it againIIno dying shaldee or  reek had higher and
holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you saw creeping
over the face of poor eueebueg, as he buietly lay in his swaying
hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final
rest, and the ocean s invisible floodItide lifted him higher and higher
towards his destined heavenb

sot a man of the crew but gave him up  and, as for eueebueg himself,
what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he
askedb  e called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was
eust breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in santucket he
had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich
warIwood of his native isle  and upon inbuiry, he had learned that all
whalemen who died in santucket, were laid in those same dark canoes,
and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him  for it was not
unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead warrior,
stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated away to
the starry archipelagoes  for not only do they believe that the stars
are isles, but that far beyond all visible horicons, their own mild,
uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens  and so form the
white breakers of the milky wayb  e added, that he shuddered at
the thought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual
seaIcustom, tossed like something vile to the deathIdevouring sharksb
soI he desired a canoe like those of santucket, all the more congenial
to him, being a whaleman, that like a whaleIboat these coffinIcanoes
were without a keel  though that involved but uncertain steering, and
much leeIway adown the dim agesb

sow, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter
was at once commanded to do eueebueg s bidding, whatever it might
includeb Ihere was some heathenish, coffinIcoloured old lumber aboard,
which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal
groves of the rackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin
was recommended to be madeb so sooner was the carpenter apprised of
the order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent
promptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took
eueebueg s measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking eueebueg s
person as he shifted the ruleb

 rhs poor fellows he ll have to die now,  eeaculated the rong bsland
sailorb

 oing to his viceIbench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general
reference, now transferringly measured on it the esact length the coffin
was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches
at its estremitiesb Ihis done, he marshalled the planks and his tools,
and to workb

uhen the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted,
he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inbuiring
whether they were ready for it yet in that directionb

everhearing the indignant but halfIhumorous cries with which the
people on deck began to drive the coffin away, eueebueg, to every one s
consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to
him, nor was there any denying him  seeing that, of all mortals, some
dying men are the most tyrannical  and certainly, since they will
shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be
indulgedb

reaning over in his hammock, eueebueg long regarded the coffin with
an attentive eyeb  e then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock
drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along
with one of the paddles of his boatb rll by his own rebuest, also,
biscuits were then ranged round the sides withinI a flask of fresh water
was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in
the hold at the foot  and a piece of sailIcloth being rolled up for a
pillow, eueebueg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he
might make trial of its comforts, if any it hadb  e lay without moving
a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little
god, eoeob Ihen crossing his arms on his breast with eoeo between, he
called for the coffin lid ihatch he called iti to be placed over himb
Ihe head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay eueebueg
in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in viewb   armai 
iit will do  it is easyi, he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced
in his hammockb

 ut ere this was done, 
ip, who had been slily hovering near by all this
while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took him
by the hand  in the other, holding his tambourineb

 
oor rovers will ye never have done with all this weary rovingn where

 b have heard,  murmured otarbuck, gacing down the scuttle,  that in
violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues 
and that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their
wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken
in their hearing by some lofty scholarsb oo, to my fond faith, poor 
ip,
in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers of all
our heavenly homesb uhere learned he that, but therenII arks he speaks

ip, that eumped from a

ruring all this, eueebueg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dreamb 
ip
was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammockb

 ut now that he had apparently made every preparation for death  now
that his coffin was proved a good fit, eueebueg suddenly rallied  soon
there seemed no need of the carpenter s bosI and thereupon, when some
espressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the
cause of his sudden convalescence was this IIat a critical moment, he
had eust recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone 
and therefore had changed his mind about dyingI he could not die yet,
he averredb Ihey asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of
his own sovereign will and pleasureb  e answered, certainlyb bn a word,
it was eueebueg s conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere
sickness could not kill himI nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some
violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sortb

sow, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civiliced 
that while a sick, civiliced man may be sis months convalescing,
generally speaking, a sick savage is almost halfIwell again in a dayb
oo, in good time my eueebueg gained strength  and at length after
sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days ibut eating with a
vigorous appetitei he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms
and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then
springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon,
pronounced himself fit for a fightb

uith a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a seaIchest  and
emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order thereb
 any spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of
grotesbue figures and drawings  and it seemed that hereby he was
striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on
his bodyb rnd this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and
seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out on
his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical
treatise on the art of attaining truth  so that eueebueg in his own
proper person was a riddle to unfold  a wondrous work in one volume  but
whose mysteries not even himself could read, though his own live heart
beat against them  and these mysteries were therefore destined in
the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were
inscribed, and so be unsolved to the lastb rnd this thought it must
have been which suggested to rhab that wild esclamation of his, when
one morning turning away from surveying poor eueebuegII eh, devilish
tantalication of the godss

rvailing himself of the mild, summerIcool weather that now reigned in
these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active
pursuits shortly to be anticipated, 
erth, the begrimed, blistered old
blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after
concluding his contributory work for rhab s leg, but still retained
it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast  being now almost
incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do
some little eob for them  altering, or repairing, or new shaping their
various weapons and boat furnitureb eften he would be surrounded by an
eager circle, all waiting to be served  holding boatIspades, pikeIheads,
harpoons, and lances, and eealously watching his every sooty movement,
as he toiledb severtheless, this old man s was a patient hammer wielded
by a patient armb so murmur, no impatience, no petulance did come from
himb oilent, slow, and solemn  bowing over still further his chronically
broken back, he toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the
heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heartb rnd so it
wasbII ost miserables

r peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing
yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage escited the
curiosity of the marinersb rnd to the importunity of their persisted
buestionings he had finally given in  and so it came to pass that every
one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fateb

 elated, and not innocently, one bitter winter s midnight, on the road
running between two country towns, the blacksmith halfIstupidly felt
the deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning,
dilapidated barnb Ihe issue was, the loss of the estremities of both
feetb eut of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four
acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied fifth
act of the grief of his life s dramab

 e was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sisty, had postponedly
encountered that thing in sorrow s technicals called ruinb  e had been
an artisan of famed escellence, and with plenty to do  owned a house
and garden  embraced a youthful, daughterIlike, loving wife, and three
blithe, ruddy children  every ounday went to a cheerfulIlooking church,
planted in a groveb  ut one night, under cover of darkness, and further
concealed in a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into
his happy home, and robbed them all of everythingb rnd darker yet to
tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into
his family s heartb bt was the  ottle soneurors bpon the opening of that
fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his homeb sow, for
prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith s shop was in
the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it  so
that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no
unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of
her youngIarmed old husband s hammer  whose reverberations, muffled by
passing through the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly,
in her nursery  and so, to stout rabor s iron lullaby, the blacksmith s
infants were rocked to slumberb

eh, woe on woes eh, reath, why canst thou not sometimes be timelyn  adst
thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon
him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a
truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after years  and
all of them a careIkilling competencyb  ut reath plucked down some
virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the
responsibilities of some other family, and left the worse than useless
old man standing, till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to
harvestb

uhy tell the wholen Ihe blows of the basement hammer every day grew more
and more between  and each blow every day grew fainter than the last 
the wife sat frocen at the window, with tearless eyes, glitteringly
gacing into the weeping faces of her children  the bellows fell  the
forge choked up with cinders  the house was sold  the mother dived
down into the long churchIyard grass  her children twice followed her
thither  and the houseless, familyless old man staggered off a vagabond
in crape  his every woe unreverenced  his grey head a scorn to flasen
curlss

reath seems the only desirable sebuel for a career like this  but reath
is only a launching into the region of the strange bntried  it is but
the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense  emote, the

sow, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of hickory,

enetrating further and further into the heart of the iapanese cruising
ground, the 
ebuod was soon all astir in the fisheryb eften, in mild,
pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on the
stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or sailing,
or paddling after the whales, or for an interlude of sisty or seventy
minutes calmly awaiting their uprising  though with but small success
for their painsb

rt such times, under an abated sun  afloat all day upon smooth, slow
heaving swells  seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe  and so
sociably mising with the soft waves themselves, that like hearthIstone
cats they purr against the gunwale  these are the times of dreamy
buietude, when beholding the tranbuil beauty and brilliancy of the
ocean s skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it  and
would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a
remorseless fangb

Ihese are the times, when in his whaleIboat the rover softly feels a
certain filial, confident, landIlike feeling towards the sea  that he
regards it as so much flowery earth  and the distant ship revealing
only the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high
rolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairieI as when
the western emigrants  horses only show their erected ears, while their
hidden bodies widely wade through the amacing verdureb

Ihe longIdrawn virgin vales  the mild blue hillIsides  as over these

the flowers of the woods are pluckedb rnd all this mises with your most
mystic mood  so that fact and fancy, halfIway meeting, interpenetrate,
and form one seamless wholeb

sor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as
temporary an effect on rhabb  ut if these secret golden keys did seem
to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon
them prove but tarnishingb

s r
Is    db Ihe 
ebuod  eets Ihe  achelorb


rnd eolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down
before the wind, some few weeks after rhab s harpoon had been weldedb

bt was a santucket ship, the  achelor, which had eust wedged in her
last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches  and now, in glad
holiday apparel, was eoyously, though somewhat vainIgloriously, sailing
round among the widelyIseparated ships on the ground, previous to
pointing her prow for homeb

Ihe three men at her mastIhead wore long streamers of narrow red bunting
at their hats  from the stern, a whaleIboat was suspended, bottom down 
and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower eaw of the
last whale they had slainb oignals, ensigns, and eacks of all colours
were flying from her rigging, on every sideb oideways lashed in each of
her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm  above which, in her
topImast crossItrees, you saw slender breakers of the same precious
fluid  and nailed to her main truck was a bracen lampb

rs was afterwards learned, the  achelor had met with the most surprising
success  all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same
seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a
single fishb sot only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to
make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional supplemental
casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met  and these were
stowed along the deck, and in the captain s and officers  stateIroomsb
sven the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindlingIwood  and the
cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oilIbutt, lashed down to the
floor for a centrepieceb bn the forecastle, the sailors had actually
caulked and pitched their chests, and filled them  it was humorously
added, that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and
filled it  that the steward had plugged his spare coffeeIpot and filled
it  that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and
filled them  that indeed everything was filled with sperm, escept the
captain s pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands
into, in selfIcomplacent testimony of his entire satisfactionb

rs this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody 
ebuod, the
barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle  and drawing
still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge
tryIpots, which, covered with the parchmentIlike 
ens or stomach skin of
the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched
hands of the crewb en the buarterIdeck, the mates and harpooneers were
dancing with the oliveIhued girls who had eloped with them from the

olynesian bsles  while suspended in an ornamented boat, firmly secured
aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three rong bsland negroes, with
glittering fiddleIbows of whale ivory, were presiding over the hilarious
eigb  eanwhile, others of the ship s company were tumultuously busy at
the masonry of the tryIworks, from which the huge pots had been
removedb eou would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed
 astille, such wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and
mortar were being hurled into the seab

rord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the
ship s elevated buarterIdeck, so that the whole reeoicing drama was
full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual
diversionb

rnd rhab, he too was standing on his buarterIdeck, shaggy and black,
with a stubborn gloom  and as the two ships crossed each other s
wakesIIone all eubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings
as to things to comeIItheir two captains in themselves impersonated the
whole striking contrast of the sceneb

 some aboard, come aboards  cried the gay  achelor s commander, lifting
a glass and a bottle in the airb

  ast seen the uhite uhalen  gritted rhab in replyb

 so  only heard of him  but don t believe in him at all,  said the other
goodIhumoredlyb  some aboards

a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst  well, then, call me an empty
ship, and outwardIboundb oo go thy ways, and b will mineb rorward theres
oet all sail, and keep her to the winds 

rnd thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breece, the other
stubbornly fought against it  and so the two vessels parted  the crew
of the 
ebuod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the receding
 achelor  but the  achelor s men never heeding their gace for the lively
revelry they were inb rnd as rhab, leaning over the taffrail, eyed the
homewardbound craft, he took from his pocket a small vial of sand, and
then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed thereby bringing two
remote associations together, for that vial was filled with santucket
soundingsb

whales were seen and four were slain  and one of them by rhabb

bt was far down the afternoon  and when all the spearings of the crimson
fight were doneI and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky, sun
and whale both stilly died together  then, such a sweetness and such
plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air, that
it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of
the  anilla isles, the opanish landIbreece, wantonly turned sailor, had
gone to sea, freighted with these vesper hymnsb

Ihe four whales slain that evening had died wide apart  one, far to
windward  one, less distant, to leeward  one ahead  one asternb Ihese
last three were brought alongside ere nightfall  but the windward one
could not be reached till morning  and the boat that had killed it lay
by its side all night  and that boat was rhab sb

Ihe waifIpole was thrust upright into the dead whale s spoutIhole  and
the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare
upon the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which
gently chafed the whale s broad flank, like soft surf upon a beachb

rhab and all his boat s crew seemed asleep but the 
arsee  who crouching
in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played round the
whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tailsb r sound
like the moaning in sbuadrons over rsphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of
 omorrah, ran shuddering through the airb

flooded worldb  b have dreamed it again,  said heb

slumbering crew arose from the boat s bottom, and ere noon the dead
whale was brought to the shipb



s r
Is     b Ihe euadrantb


Ihe season for the rine at length drew near  and every day when rhab,
coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would
ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners buickly run to
the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fised
on the nailed doubloon  impatient for the order to point the ship s
prow for the ebuatorb bn good time the order cameb bt was hard upon high
noon  and rhab, seated in the bows of his highIhoisted boat, was
about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his
latitudeb

sow, in that iapanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of
effulgencesb Ihat unblinkingly vivid iapanese sun seems the blacing
focus of the glassy ocean s immeasurable burningIglassb Ihe sky looks
lacbuered  clouds there are none  the horicon floats  and this nakedness
of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of  od s throneb
uell that rhab s buadrant was furnished with coloured glasses, through
which to take sight of that solar fireb oo, swinging his seated form
to the roll of the ship, and with his astrologicalIlooking instrument
placed to his eye, he remained in that posture for some moments to
catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridianb
 eantime while his whole attention was absorbed, the 
arsee was kneeling
beneath him on the ship s deck, and with face thrown up like rhab s,
was eyeing the same sun with him  only the lids of his eyes half hooded
their orbs, and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessnessb
rt length the desired observation was taken  and with his pencil upon
his ivory leg, rhab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that
precise instantb Ihen falling into a moment s revery, he again looked up
towards the sun and murmured to himselfI  Ihou seaImarks thou high and
mighty 
ilots thou tellest me truly where b r IIbut canst thou cast the
least hint where b o rrr ben er canst thou tell where some other thing
besides me is this moment livingn uhere is  oby rickn Ihis instant thou
must be eyeing himb Ihese eyes of mine look into the very eye that is
even now beholding him  aye, and into the eye that is even now ebually
beholding the obeects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou suns 

Ihen gacing at his buadrant, and handling, one after the other, its
numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and mutteredI
 roolish toys babies  plaything of haughty rdmirals, and sommodores, and
saptains  the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might  but what
after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where thou
thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that holds
theeI nos not one eot mores Ihou canst not tell where one drop of water
or one grain of sand will be toImorrow noon  and yet with thy impotence

vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now scorched
with thy light, e suns revel by nature to this earth s horicon are the
glances of man s eyes  not shot from the crown of his head, as if  od

rs the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live
and dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for rhab, and a
fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himselfIIthese passed over
the mute, motionless 
arsee s faceb bnobserved he rose and glided away 
while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered
together on the forecastle, till rhab, troubledly pacing the deck,

sky, like an esploding bomb upon a daced and sleepy townb

Iowards evening of that day, the 
ebuod was torn of her canvas, and
bareIpoled was left to fight a Iyphoon which had struck her directly
aheadb uhen darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the
thunder, and blaced with the lightning, that showed the disabled masts
fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the
tempest had left for its after sportb

 olding by a shroud, otarbuck was standing on the buarterIdeck  at every
flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional disaster
might have befallen the intricate hamper there  while otubb and rlask
were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the
boatsb  ut all their pains seemed naughtb Ihough lifted to the very
top of the cranes, the windward buarter boat irhab si did not escapeb

into a fair wind that will drive us towards homeb eonder, to windward,
all is blackness of doom  but to leeward, homewardIIb see it lightens up
there  but not with the lightningb 

rt that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following
the flashes, a voice was heard at his side  and almost at the same
instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overheadb

 uho s theren 

 eld Ihunders  said rhab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his
pivotIhole  but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed
lances of fireb

sow, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off
the perilous fluid into the soil  so the kindred rod which at sea some
ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the waterb  ut
as this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may
avoid all contact with the hull  and as moreover, if kept constantly
towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering
not a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the
vessel s way in the water  because of all this, the lower parts of a
ship s lightningIrods are not always overboard  but are generally made
in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the
chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may rebuireb

 Ihe rodss the rodss  cried otarbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished to

rll the yardIarms were tipped with a pallid fire  and touched at each
triIpointed lightningIrodIend with three tapering white flames, each of
the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like
three gigantic was tapers before an altarb

  last the boats let it gos  cried otubb at this instant, as a swashing
sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently
eammed his hand, as he was passing a lashingb   last its IIbut
slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames  and
immediately shifting his tone he criedII Ihe corpusants have mercy on us

Io sailors, oaths are household words  they will swear in the trance of

 od s burning finger has been laid on the ship  when  is   ene,  ene,
Iekel bpharsin  has been woven into the shrouds and the cordageb

uhile this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the
enchanted crew  who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle,
all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away
constellation of starsb  elieved against the ghostly light, the gigantic

to glimmer into sightb  lancing upwards, he criedI  oees sees  and once

rt the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame,
the 
arsee was kneeling in rhab s front, but with his head bowed away
from him  while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where
they had eust been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,
arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a
knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twigb bn various enchanted
attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running skeletons in

rhab s harpoon, the one forged at 
erth s fire, remained firmly lashed
in its conspicuous crotch, so that it proeected beyond his whaleIboat s

sheath to drop off  and from the keen steel barb there now came a

burning harpoon, rhab waved it like a torch among them  swearing to

ruring the most violent shocks of the Iyphoon, the man at the 
ebuod s
eawIbone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by
its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached
to itIIfor they were slackIIbecause some play to the tiller was
indispensableb

bn a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock
to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the
compasses, at intervals, go round and roundb bt was thus with the

ebuod s  at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice
the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards  it is
a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted
emotionb

oome hours after midnight, the Iyphoon abated so much, that through the
strenuous esertions of otarbuck and otubbIIone engaged forward and the
other aftIIthe shivered remnants of the eib and fore and mainItopIsails
were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like
the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds when
that stormItossed bird is on the wingb

Ihe three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a
stormItrysail was set further aft  so that the ship soon went through
the water with some precision again  and the courseIIfor the present,
sastIsouthIeastIIwhich he was to steer, if practicable, was once more
given to the helmsmanb ror during the violence of the gale, he had only
steered according to its vicissitudesb  ut as he was now bringing the
ship as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile, los
a good signs the wind seemed coming round astern  aye, the foul breece
became fairs

bnstantly the yards were sbuared, to the lively song of   es I s
rrb  ubsrs e IesI e, s ss re  sss  the crew singing for eoy, that so
promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents
preceding itb

bn compliance with the standing order of his commanderIIto report
immediately, and at any one of the twentyIfour hours, any decided change
in the affairs of the deck,IIotarbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to
the breeceIIhowever reluctantly and gloomily,IIthan he mechanically went
below to apprise saptain rhab of the circumstanceb

sre knocking at his stateIroom, he involuntarily paused before it
a momentb Ihe cabin lampIItaking long swings this way and thatIIwas
burning fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man s bolted
door,IIa thin one, with fised blinds inserted, in place of upper panelsb
Ihe isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming
silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of
the elementsb Ihe loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed, as
they stood upright against the forward bulkheadb otarbuck was an honest,
upright man  but out of otarbuck s heart, at that instant when he saw
the muskets, there strangely evolved an evil thought  but so blent with
its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew
it for itselfb

Is   d b Ihe seedleb


sest morning the notIyetIsubsided sea rolled in long slow billows of
mighty bulk, and striving in the 
ebuod s gurgling track, pushed her on
like giants  palms outspreadb Ihe strong, unstaggering breece abounded
so, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails  the whole world
boomed before the windb  uffled in the full morning light, the invisible
sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place  where his
bayonet rays moved on in stacksb smblaconings, as of crowned  abylonian
kings and bueens, reigned over everythingb Ihe sea was as a crucible of
molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with light and heatb

rong maintaining an enchanted silence, rhab stood apart  and every time
the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to eye
the bright sun s rays produced ahead  and when she profoundly settled by
the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun s rearward place, and how
the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wakeb

  a, ha, my ships thou mightest well be taken now for the seaIchariot of
the sunb  o, hos all ye nations before my prow, b bring the sun to yes
eoke on the further billows  hallos a tandem, b drive the seas 

 ut suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards the
helm, huskily demanding how the ship was headingb

 sastIsouIeast, sir,  said the frightened steersmanb

 Ihou liests  smiting him with his clenched fistb   eading sast at this
hour in the morning, and the sun asternn 

bpon this every soul was confounded  for the phenomenon eust then
observed by rhab had unaccountably escaped every one else  but its very
blinding palpableness must have been the causeb

Ihrusting his head half way into the binnacle, rhab caught one glimpse
of the compasses  his uplifted arm slowly fell  for a moment he almost
seemed to staggerb otanding behind him otarbuck looked, and los the two
compasses pointed sast, and the 
ebuod was as infallibly going uestb

 ut ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew,
the old man with a rigid laugh esclaimed,  b have its bt has happened
beforeb  rb otarbuck, last night s thunder turned our compassesIIthat s
allb Ihou hast before now heard of such a thing, b take itb 

 rye  but never before has it happened to me, sir,  said the pale mate,
gloomilyb

 ere, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than
one case occurred to ships in violent stormsb Ihe magnetic energy, as
developed in the mariner s needle, is, as all know, essentially one with
the electricity beheld in heaven  hence it is not to be much marvelled
at, that such things should beb bnstances where the lightning has
actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars and
rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal 
all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before magnetic
steel was of no more use than an old wife s knitting needleb  ut in
either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the original
virtue thus marred or lost  and if the binnacle compasses be affected,
the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship  even were
the lowermost one inserted into the kelsonb

reliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed
compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his estended hand, now took
the precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were
esactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship s course to be
changed accordinglyb Ihe yards were hard up  and once more the 
ebuod
thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair
one had only been euggling herb

 eanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, otarbuck said nothing,
but buietly he issued all rebuisite orders  while otubb and rlaskIIwho
in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelingsIIlikewise
unmurmuringly acbuiescedb rs for the men, though some of them lowly
rumbled, their fear of rhab was greater than their fear of rateb  ut as
ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed 
or if impressed, it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their
congenial hearts from inflesible rhab sb

ror a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveriesb  ut
chancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper
sightItubes of the buadrant he had the day before dashed to the deckb

 Ihou poor, proud heavenIgacer and sun s pilots yesterday b wrecked
thee, and toIday the compasses would fain have wrecked meb oo, sob  ut
rhab is lord over the level loadstone yetb  rb otarbuckIIa lance without
a pole  a topImaul, and the smallest of the sailImaker s needlesb
euicks 

rccessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about
to do, were certain prudential motives, whose obeect might have been to
revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a
matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compassesb  esides, the old
man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily
practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors,
without some shudderings and evil portentsb

  en,  said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed
him the things he had demanded,  my men, the thunder turned old rhab s
needles  but out of this bit of steel rhab can make one of his own, that
will point as true as anyb 

rbashed glances of servile wonder were eschanged by the sailors, as this
was said  and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might
followb  ut otarbuck looked awayb

uith a blow from the topImaul rhab knocked off the steel head of the
lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade
him hold it upright, without its touching the deckb Ihen, with the maul,
after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he placed the
blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly hammered
that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as beforeb Ihen
going through some small strange motions with itIIwhether indispensable
to the magneticing of the steel, or merely intended to augment the awe
of the crew, is uncertainIIhe called for linen thread  and moving to the
binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there, and horicontally
suspended the sailIneedle by its middle, over one of the compassIcardsb
rt first, the steel went round and round, buivering and vibrating at
either end  but at last it settled to its place, when rhab, who had
been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly back from the
binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it, esclaimed,II rook
ye, for yourselves, if rhab be not lord of the level loadstones Ihe sun
is sast, and that compass swears its 

ene after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could
persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk
awayb

bn his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw rhab in all his
fatal prideb

uhile now the fated 
ebuod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log
and line had but very seldom been in useb ewing to a confident reliance
upon other means of determining the vessel s place, some merchantmen,
and many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave the
log  though at the same time, and frebuently more for form s sake than
anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the
course steered by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate of
progression every hourb bt had been thus with the

hung so idlyb  ut heedless of all this, his mood seiced rhab, as he
happened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet scene,

oteering now southIeastward by rhab s levelled steel, and her progress
solely determined by rhab s level log and line  the 
ebuod held on
her path towards the sbuatorb  aking so long a passage through such
unfrebuented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways impelled
by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild  all these seemed
the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate sceneb

rt last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the
sbuatorial fishingIground, and in the deep darkness that goes before the
dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets  the watchIIthen headed
by rlaskIIwas startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthlyIIlike
halfIarticulated wailings of the ghosts of all  erod s murdered
bnnocentsIIthat one and all, they started from their reveries, and for
the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all transfisedly
listening, like the carved  oman slave, while that wild cry remained
within hearingb Ihe shristian or civiliced part of the crew said it was
mermaids, and shuddered  but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalledb
eet the grey  ansmanIIthe oldest mariner of allIIdeclared that the wild
thrilling sounds that were heard, were the voices of newly drowned men
in the seab

 elow in his hammock, rhab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when
he came to the deck  it was then recounted to him by rlask, not
unaccompanied with hinted dark meaningsb  e hollowly laughed, and thus
esplained the wonderb

Ihose rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers
of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or some dams
that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and kept company
with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of wailb  ut this
only the more affected some of them, because most mariners cherish a
very superstitious feeling about seals, arising not only from their
peculiar tones when in distress, but also from the human look of their
round heads and semiIintelligent faces, seen peeringly uprising from
the water alongsideb bn the sea, under certain circumstances, seals have
more than once been mistaken for menb

 ut the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible
confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morningb rt
sunIrise this man went from his hammock to his mastIhead at the fore 
and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep ifor
sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition statei, whether it was thus
with the man, there is now no telling  but, be that as it may, he
had not been long at his perch, when a cry was heardIIa cry and a
rushingIIand looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air  and
looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the
seab

Ihe lifeIbuoyIIa long slender caskIIwas dropped from the stern, where it
always hung obedient to a cunning spring  but no hand rose to seice it,
and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it
slowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every pore  and
the studded ironIbound cask followed the sailor to the bottom, as if to
yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard oneb

rnd thus the first man of the 
ebuod that mounted the mast to look out
for the uhite uhale, on the uhite uhale s own peculiar ground  that man
was swallowed up in the deepb  ut few, perhaps, thought of that at the
timeb bndeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at
least as a portent  for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of evil
in the future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presagedb Ihey
declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had
heard the night beforeb  ut again the old  ansman said nayb

Ihe lost lifeIbuoy was now to be replaced  otarbuck was directed to see
to it  but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as
in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of
the voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly
connected with its final end, whatever that might prove to be 
therefore, they were going to leave the ship s stern unprovided with a
buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes eueebueg hinted a hint
concerning his coffinb

s r
Is   d b Ihe 
ebuod  eets Ihe  achelb


sest day, a large ship, the  achel, was descried, bearing directly down
upon the 
ebuod, all her spars thickly clustering with menb rt the
time the 
ebuod was making good speed through the water  but as the
broadIwinged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all
fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from
the smitten hullb

  ad news  she brings bad news,  muttered the old  ansmanb  ut ere her
commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat  ere he
could hopefully hail, rhab s voice was heardb

  ast seen the uhite uhalen 

 rye, yesterdayb  ave ye seen a whaleIboat adriftn 

Ihrottling his eoy, rhab negatively answered this unespected buestion 
and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger captain
himself, having stopped his vessel s way, was seen descending her
sideb r few keen pulls, and his boatIhook soon clinched the 
ebuod s
mainIchains, and he sprang to the deckb bmmediately he was recognised by
rhab for a santucketer he knewb  ut no formal salutation was eschangedb

 uhere was henIInot killedsIInot killeds  cried rhab, closely advancingb
  ow was itn 

bt seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous, while
three of the stranger s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales, which
had led them some four or five miles from the ship  and while they were
yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head of  oby rick had
suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to leeward  whereupon,
the fourth rigged boatIIa reserved oneIIhad been instantly lowered in
chaseb rfter a keen sail before the wind, this fourth boatIIthe swiftest
keeled of allIIseemed to have succeeded in fasteningIIat least, as
well as the man at the mastIhead could tell anything about itb bn the
distance he saw the diminished dotted boat  and then a swift gleam
of bubbling white water  and after that nothing more  whence it was
concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with
his pursuers, as often happensb Ihere was some apprehension, but no
positive alarm, as yetb Ihe recall signals were placed in the rigging 
darkness came on  and forced to pick up her three far to windward
boatsIIere going in buest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite
directionIIthe ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to
its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance
from itb  ut the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded
all sailIIstunsail on stunsailIIafter the missing boat  kindling a fire
in her tryIpots for a beacon  and every other man aloft on the lookIoutb
 ut though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the
presumed place of the absent ones when last seen  though she then
paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her  and not finding
anything, had again dashed on  again paused, and lowered her boats  and
though she had thus continued doing till daylight  yet not the least
glimpse of the missing keel had been seenb

Ihe story told, the stranger saptain immediately went on to reveal his
obeect in boarding the 
ebuodb  e desired that ship to unite with his
own in the search  by sailing over the sea some four or five miles
apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horicon, as it wereb

 b will wager something now,  whispered otubb to rlask,  that some one
in that missing boat wore off that saptain s best coat  mayhap, his
watchIIhe s so cursed ansious to get it backb uho ever heard of two
pious whaleIships cruising after one missing whaleIboat in the height of
the whaling seasonn oee, rlask, only see how pale he looksIIpale in the
very buttons of his eyesIIlookIIit wasn t the coatIIit must have been
theII 

  y boy, my own boy is among themb ror  od s sakeIIb beg, b
coneure IIhere esclaimed the stranger saptain to rhab, who thus far
had but icily received his petitionb  ror eightIandIforty hours let me
charter your shipIIb will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for itIIif
there be no other wayIIfor eightIandIforty hours onlyIIonly thatIIyou
must, oh, you must, and you o rrr do this thingb 

  is sons  cried otubb,  oh, it s his son he s losts b take back the
coat and watchIIwhat says rhabn ue must save that boyb 

  e s drowned with the rest on  em, last night,  said the old  ans
sailor standing behind them   b heard  all of ye heard their spiritsb 

sow, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the  achel s
the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the
saptain s sons among the number of the missing boat s crew  but among
the number of the other boat s crews, at the same time, but on the other
hand, separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase,
there had been still another son  as that for a time, the wretched
father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplesity  which
was only solved for him by his chief mate s instinctively adopting the
ordinary procedure of a whaleIship in such emergencies, that is, when
placed between eeopardiced but divided boats, always to pick up the
maeority firstb  ut the captain, for some unknown constitutional reason,
had refrained from mentioning all this, and not till forced to it by
rhab s iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy  a little lad,
but twelve years old, whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving
hardihood of a santucketer s paternal love, had thus early sought to
initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially
the destiny of all his raceb sor does it unfrebuently occur, that
santucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them,
for a protracted three or four years  voyage in some other ship than
their own  so that their first knowledge of a whaleman s career shall
be unenervated by any chance display of a father s natural but untimely
partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and concernb

 eantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of rhab 
and rhab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without
the least buivering of his ownb

 b will not go,  said the stranger,  till you say aye to meb ro to me
as you would have me do to you in the like caseb ror eeb too have a boy,
saptain rhabIIthough but a child, and nestling safely at home nowIIa
child of your old age tooIIees, yes, you relent  b see itIIrun, run,
men, now, and stand by to sbuare in the yardsb 

 rvast,  cried rhabII touch not a ropeIyarn   then in a voice that
prolongingly moulded every wordII saptain  ardiner, b will not do itb
sven now b lose timeb  oodIbye, goodIbyeb  od bless ye, man, and may b
forgive myself, but b must gob  rb otarbuck, look at the binnacle watch,
and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangersI
then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as beforeb 

 urriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,
leaving the strange captain transfised at this unconditional and utter
reeection of his so earnest suitb  ut starting from his enchantment,
 ardiner silently hurried to the side  more fell than stepped into his
boat, and returned to his shipb

ooon the two ships diverged their wakes  and long as the strange vessel
was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,
however small, on the seab Ihis way and that her yards were swung round 
starboard and larboard, she continued to tack  now she beat against a
head sea  and again it pushed her before it  while all the while, her
masts and yards were thickly clustered with men, as three tall cherry
trees, when the boys are cherrying among the boughsb

 ut by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly saw
that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without comfortb
ohe was  achel, weeping for her children, because they were notb

rnd now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a
preliminary cruise, rhab,IIall other whaling waters sweptIIseemed to
have chased his foe into an oceanIfold, to slay him the more securely
there  now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and
longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted  now that a
vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually
encountered  oby rick IIand now that all his successive meetings with
various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference
with which the white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned
against  now it was that there lurked a something in the old man s eyes,
which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to seeb rs the unsetting
polar star, which through the livelong, arctic, sis months  night
sustains its piercing, steady, central gace  so rhab s purpose now
fisedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crewb bt
domineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings,
fears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a
single spear or leafb

bn this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,
vanishedb otubb no more strove to raise a smile  otarbuck no more strove
to check oneb rlike, eoy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed ground to
finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped mortar of
rhab s iron soulb rike machines, they dumbly moved about the deck, ever
conscious that the old man s despot eye was on themb

 ut did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours  when
he thought no glance but one was on him  then you would have seen that
even as rhab s eyes so awed the crew s, the inscrutable 
arsee s glance
awed his  or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected itb
ouch an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin redallah
now  such ceaseless shudderings shook him  that the men looked dubious
at him  half uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal
substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen
being s bodyb rnd that shadow was always hovering thereb ror not by
night, even, had redallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go
belowb  e would stand still for hoursI but never sat or leaned  his wan
but wondrous eyes did plainly sayIIue two watchmen never restb

sor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the
deck, unless rhab was before them  either standing in his pivotIhole, or
esactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,IIthe mainImast
and the micen  or else they saw him standing in the cabinIscuttle,IIhis
living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to step  his hat slouched
heavily over his eyes  so that however motionless he stood, however the
days and nights were added on, that he had not swung in his hammock 
yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never tell unerringly
whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at times  or whether
he was still intently scanning them  no matter, though he stood so in
the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded nightIdamp
gathered in beads of dew upon that stoneIcarved coat and hatb Ihe
clothes that the night had wet, the nest day s sunshine dried upon him 
and so, day after day, and night after night  he went no more beneath
the planks  whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent forb

 e ate in the same open air  that is, his two only meals,IIbreakfast and
dinnerI supper he never touched  nor reaped his beard  which darkly grew
all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still grow
idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdureb  ut though
his whole life was now become one watch on deck  and though the 
arsee s
mystic watch was without intermission as his own  yet these two never
seemed to speakIIone man to the otherIIunless at long intervals some
passing unmomentous matter made it necessaryb Ihough such a potent spell
seemed secretly to eoin the twain  openly, and to the aweIstruck crew,
they seemed poleIlike asunderb bf by day they chanced to speak one word 
by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the slightest verbal
interchangeb rt times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they
stood far parted in the starlight  rhab in his scuttle, the 
arsee by
the mainmast  but still fisedly gacing upon each other  as if in the

arsee rhab saw his forethrown shadow, in rhab the 
arsee his abandoned
substanceb

rnd yet, somehow, did rhabIIin his own proper self, as daily, hourly,
and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,IIrhab
seemed an independent lord  the 
arsee but his slaveb otill again both
seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them  the lean shade
siding the solid ribb ror be this 
arsee what he may, all rib and keel
was solid rhabb

rt the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard

 ut when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the
childrenIseeking  achel  and no spout had yet been seen  the monomaniac
old man seemed distrustful of his crew s fidelity  at least, of nearly
all escept the 
agan harpooneers  he seemed to doubt, even, whether
otubb and rlask might not willingly overlook the sight he soughtb  ut if
these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from verbally
espressing them, however his actions might seem to hint themb

 b will have the first sight of the whale myself, IIhe saidb  ryes
rhab must have the doubloons  and with his own hands he rigged a nest
of basketed bowlines  and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved
block, to secure to the mainImast head, he received the two ends of the
downwardIreeved rope  and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for
the other end, in order to fasten it at the railb Ihis done, with that
end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round upon
his crew, sweeping from one to the other  pausing his glance long upon
raggoo, eueebueg, Iashtego  but shunning redallah  and then settling his
firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,II Iake the rope, sirIIb give
it into thy hands, otarbuckb  Ihen arranging his person in the basket,
he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch, otarbuck being
the one who secured the rope at last  and afterwards stood near itb rnd
thus, with one hand clinging round the royal mast, rhab gaced abroad
upon the sea for miles and miles,IIahead, astern, this side, and
that,IIwithin the wide espanded circle commanded at so great a heightb

uhen in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in
the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is
hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope  under these
circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge
to some one man who has the special watch of itb  ecause in such a
wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations aloft
cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the
deck  and when the deckIends of these ropes are being every few minutes
cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural fatality, if,
unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some
carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the
seab oo rhab s proceedings in this matter were not unusual  the only
strange thing about them seemed to be, that otarbuck, almost the one
only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the
slightest degree approaching to decisionIIone of those too, whose
faithfulness on the lookIout he had seemed to doubt somewhat IIit was
strange, that this was the very man he should select for his watchman 
freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person s
handsb

sow, the first time rhab was perched aloft  ere he had been there ten
minutes  one of those redIbilled savage seaIhawks which so often fly
incommodiously close round the manned mastIheads of whalemen in these
latitudes  one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head
in a mace of untrackably swift circlingsb Ihen it darted a thousand feet
straight up into the air  then spiraliced downwards, and went eddying
again round his headb

 ut with his gace fised upon the dim and distant horicon, rhab seemed
not to mark this wild bird  nor, indeed, would any one else have marked
it much, it being no uncommon circumstance  only now almost the least
heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every
sightb

 eour hat, your hat, sirs  suddenly cried the oicilian seaman, who
being posted at the micenImastIhead, stood directly behind rhab, though
somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing
themb

 ut already the sable wing was before the old man s eyes  the long
hooked bill at his headI with a scream, the black hawk darted away with
his priceb

rn eagle flew thrice round Iarbuin s head, removing his cap to replace
it, and thereupon Ianabuil, his wife, declared that Iarbuin would
be king of  omeb  ut only by the replacing of the cap was that omen
accounted goodb rhab s hat was never restored  the wild hawk flew on and
on with it  far in advance of the prowI and at last disappeared  while
from the point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was dimly
discerned, falling from that vast height into the seab

fised upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some whalingIships,
cross the buarterIdeck at the height of eight or nine feet  serving to
carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boatsb

bpon the stranger s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and

Is    db Ihe oymphonyb


bt was a clear steelIblue dayb Ihe firmaments of air and sea were
hardly separable in that allIpervading acure  only, the pensive air was
transparently pure and soft, with a woman s look, and the robust and
manIlike sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as oamson s
chest in his sleepb

 ither, and thither, on high, glided the snowIwhite wings of small,
unspeckled birds  these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air 
but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed
mighty leviathans, swordIfish, and sharks  and these were the strong,
troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine seab

 ut though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and
shadows without  those two seemed one  it was only the ses, as it were,
that distinguished themb

rloft, like a royal ccar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle
air to this bold and rolling sea  even as bride to groomb rnd at the
girdling line of the horicon, a soft and tremulous motionIImost seen

alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom awayb

Iied up and twisted  gnarled and knotted with wrinkles  haggardly firm
and unyielding  his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the

little  iriam and  artha, laughingIeyed elves, heedlessly gambol around
their old sire  sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on
the marge of that burntIout crater of his brainb

olowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, rhab leaned over the side and
watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gace, the more
and the more that he strove to pierce the profundityb  ut the lovely
aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a moment,
the cankerous thing in his soulb Ihat glad, happy air, that winsome

nor did all the 
acific contain such wealth as that one wee dropb

s r
Is     b Ihe shaseIIrirst rayb


Ihat night, in the midIwatch, when the old manIIas his wont at
intervalsIIstepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went
to his pivotIhole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing
up the sea air as a sagacious ship s dog will, in drawing nigh to
some barbarous isleb  e declared that a whale must be nearb ooon that
peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the
living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch  nor was any mariner
surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dogIvane, and
then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible,
rhab rapidly ordered the ship s course to be slightly altered, and the
sail to be shortenedb

Ihe acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated
at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and
lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery
wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallicIlike marks of some swift
tideIrip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid streamb

  an the mastIheadss sall all handss 

Ihundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle
deck, raggoo roused the sleepers with such eudgment claps that they
seemed to eshale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear
with their clothes in their handsb

 sothing, nothing sirs  was the sound hailing down in replyb

 I gallant sailssIIstunsailss alow and aloft, and on both sidess 

rll sail being set, he now cast loose the lifeIline, reserved for
swaying him to the main royalImast head  and in a few moments they were
hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft,
and while peering ahead through the horicontal vacancy between the
mainItopIsail and topIgallantIsail, he raised a gullIlike cry in the
airb  Ihere she blowssIIthere she blowss r hump like a snowIhills bt is

rired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three
lookIouts, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous
whale they had so long been pursuingb rhab had now gained his final
perch, some feet above the other lookIouts, Iashtego standing eust
beneath him on the cap of the topIgallantImast, so that the bndian s
head was almost on a level with rhab s heelb rrom this height the whale
was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing
his high sparkling hump, and regularly eetting his silent spout into the
airb Io the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had
so long ago beheld in the moonlit rtlantic and bndian eceansb

rike noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea 
but only slowly they neared the foeb rs they neared him, the ocean grew
still more smooth  seemed drawing a carpet over its waves  seemed a
noonImeadow, so serenely it spreadb rt length the breathless hunter came
so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire daccling hump
was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing,
and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish
foamb  e saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly proeecting head
beyondb  efore it, far out on the soft IurkishIrugged waters, went
the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical
rippling playfully accompanying the shade  and behind, the blue waters
interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake 
and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his sideb  ut
these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly
feathering the sea, alternate with their fitful flight  and like to
some flagIstaff rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but
shattered pole of a recent lance proeected from the white whale s back 
and at intervals one of the cloud of softItoed fowls hovering, and
to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and
rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennonsb

r gentle eoyousnessIIa mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested
the gliding whaleb sot the white bull iupiter swimming away with
ravished suropa clinging to his graceful horns  his lovely, leering
eyes sideways intent upon the maid  with smooth bewitching fleetness,

divinely swamb

en each soft sideIIcoincident with the parted swell, that but once
leaving him, then flowed so wide awayIIon each bright side, the whale
shed off enticingsb so wonder there had been some among the hunters who
namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured
to assail it  but had fatally found that buietude but the vesture of
tornadoesb eet calm, enticing calm, oh, whales thou glidest on, to all
who for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way
thou may st have beeuggled and destroyed beforeb

rnd thus, through the serene tranbuillities of the tropical sea, among
waves whose handIclappings were suspended by esceeding rapture,  oby
rick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his
submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his eawb
 ut soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water  for an instant
his whole marbleiced body formed a high arch, like iirginia s satural
 ridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air, the
grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sightb  overingly
halting, and dipping on the wing, the white seaIfowls longingly lingered
over the agitated pool that he leftb

uith oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the
three boats now stilly floated, awaiting  oby rick s reappearanceb

 rn hour,  said rhab, standing rooted in his boat s stern  and he gaced
beyond the whale s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing
vacancies to leewardb bt was only an instant  for again his eyes seemed
whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circleb Ihe breece now
freshened  the sea began to swellb

 Ihe birdssIIthe birdss  cried Iashtegob

bn long bndian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were
now all flying towards rhab s boat  and when within a few yards began
fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with eoyous,
espectant criesb Iheir vision was keener than man s  rhab could discover
no sign in the seab  ut suddenly as he peered down and down into its
depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white
weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it rose,
till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked
rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the undiscoverable
bottomb bt was  oby rick s open mouth and scrolled eaw  his vast,
shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the seab Ihe
glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an openIdoored marble
tomb  and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, rhab whirled
the craft aside from this tremendous apparitionb Ihen, calling upon
redallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and
seicing 
erth s harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and
stand by to sternb

sow, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its asis, its
bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale s head while yet
under waterb  ut as if perceiving this stratagem,  oby rick, with that
malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself,
as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath
the boatb

Ihrough and through  through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for
an instant, the whale oblibuely lying on his back, in the manner of
a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his
mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower eaw curled high up into
the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a rowIlockb Ihe bluish
pearlIwhite of the inside of the eaw was within sis inches of rhab s
head, and reached higher than thatb bn this attitude the uhite uhale
now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouseb uith
unastonished eyes redallah gaced, and crossed his arms  but the
tigerIyellow crew were tumbling over each other s heads to gain the
uttermost sternb

rnd now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the
whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way  and from his
body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from
the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were  and
while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a buick crisis
impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac rhab, furious with
this tantalicing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and
helpless in the very eaws he hated  frencied with all this, he seiced
the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from
its gripeb rs now he thus vainly strove, the eaw slipped from him  the
frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both eaws, like an
enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in twain,
and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the two
floating wrecksb Ihese floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew
at the sternIwreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast
to the oars to lash them acrossb

rt that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, rhab, the first
to perceive the whale s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a
movement that loosed his hold for the time  at that moment his hand
had made one final effort to push the boat out of the biteb  ut only
slipping further into the whale s mouth, and tilting over sideways as it
slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the eaw  spilled him out of
it, as he leaned to the push  and so he fell flatIfaced upon the seab

 ipplingly withdrawing from his prey,  oby rick now lay at a little
distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the
billows  and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body 
so that when his vast wrinkled forehead roseIIsome twenty or more feet
out of the waterIIthe now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,
dacclingly broke against it  vindictively tossing their shivered spray
still higher into the airbi oo, in a gale, the but half baffled shannel
billows only recoil from the base of the sddystone, triumphantly to
overleap its summit with their scudb


iIhis motion is peculiar to the sperm whaleb bt receives its designation
ipitchpolingi from its being likened to that preliminary upIandIdown
poise of the whaleIlance, in the esercise called pitchpoling, previously
describedb  y this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively
view whatever obeects may be encircling himb


 ut soon resuming his horicontal attitude,  oby rick swam swiftly round
and round the wrecked crew  sideways churning the water in his vengeful
wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assaultb
Ihe sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of
grapes and mulberries cast before rntiochus s elephants in the book
of  accabeesb  eanwhile rhab half smothered in the foam of the whale s
insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,IIthough he could still
keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that  helpless
rhab s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock
might burstb rrom the boat s fragmentary stern, redallah incuriously and
mildly eyed him  the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not
succor him  more than enough was it for them to look to themselvesb
ror so revolvingly appalling was the uhite uhale s aspect, and so
planetarily swift the everIcontracting circles he made, that he seemed
horicontally swooping upon themb rnd though the other boats, unharmed,
still hovered hard by  still they dared not pull into the eddy to
strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of
the eeopardiced castaways, rhab and all  nor in that case could they
themselves hope to escapeb uith straining eyes, then, they remained on
the outer edge of the direful cone, whose centre had now become the old
man s headb

 eantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship s
mast heads  and sbuaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene 
and was now so nigh, that rhab in the water hailed hersII oail on
the IIbut that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from  oby rick, and

Ihe 
ebuod s prows were pointed  and breaking up the charmed circle, she
effectually parted the white whale from his victimb rs he sullenly swam
off, the boats flew to the rescueb

rragged into otubb s boat with bloodIshot, blinded eyes, the white brine
caking in his wrinkles  the long tension of rhab s bodily strength did
crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body s doomI for a time, lying
all crushed in the bottom of otubb s boat, like one trodden under foot
of herds of elephantsb rar inland, nameless wails came from him, as
desolate sounds from out ravinesb

 ut this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more
abbreviate itb bn an instant s compass, great hearts sometimes condense
to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused
through feebler men s whole livesb rnd so, such hearts, though summary
in each one suffering  still, if the gods decree it, in their
lifeItime aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous
intensities  for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures
contain the entire circumferences of inferior soulsb

bt is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked
up by another boat, help to work that second boat  and the chase is thus
continued with what is called doubleIbanked oarsb bt was thus nowb  ut
the added power of the boat did not ebual the added power of the whale,
for he seemed to have trebleIbanked his every fin  swimming with a
velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these circumstances,
pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a
hopeless one  nor could any crew endure for so long a period, such an
unintermitted, intense straining at the oar  a thing barely tolerable
only in some one brief vicissitudeb Ihe ship itself, then, as it
sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate means of
overtaking the chaseb rccordingly, the boats now made for her, and were
soon swayed up to their cranesIIthe two parts of the wrecked boat having
been previously secured by herIIand then hoisting everything to her
side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it
with stunIsails, like the doubleIeointed wings of an albatross  the

ebuod bore down in the leeward wake of  obyIrickb rt the well known,
methodic intervals, the whale s glittering spout was regularly announced
from the manned mastIheads  and when he would be reported as eust gone
down, rhab would take the time, and then pacing the deck, binnacleIwatch
in hand, so soon as the last second of the allotted hour espired, his
voice was heardbII uhose is the doubloon nown r ye see himn  and if the
reply was, so, sirs straightway he commanded them to lift him to his
perchb bn this way the day wore on  rhab, now aloft and motionless 
anon, unrestingly pacing the planksb

rs he was thus walking, uttering no sound, escept to hail the men aloft,
or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a still
greater breadthIIthus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat, at
every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped upon
the buarterIdeck, and lay there reversed  broken bow to shattered sternb
rt last he paused before it  and as in an already overIclouded sky fresh
troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old man s face
there now stole some such added gloom as thisb

otubb saw him pause  and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to
evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in
his saptain s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck esclaimedII Ihe

 ere be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale,
continued through day into night, and through night into day, is a thing
by no means unprecedented in the oouth sea fisheryb ror such is the
wonderful skill, prescience of esperience, and invincible confidence
acbuired by some great natural geniuses among the santucket commanders 
that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they
will, under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both
the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while out of
sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that periodb
rnd, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of
a coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which he desires
shortly to return to again, but at some further point  like as this
pilot stands by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the
cape at present visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright
the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be visitedI so does the
fisherman, at his compass, with the whale  for after being chased, and
diligently marked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night
obscures the fish, the creature s future wake through the darkness
is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the
pilot s coast is to himb oo that to this hunter s wondrous skill, the
proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all
desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast landb rnd as the
mighty iron reviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in
its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time his rate as
doctors that of a baby s pulse  and lightly say of it, the up train or
the down train will reach such or such a spot, at such or such an hour 
even so, almost, there are occasions when these santucketers time that
other reviathan of the deep, according to the observed humor of his
speed  and say to themselves, so many hours hence this whale will have
gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this or that degree of
latitude or longitudeb  ut to render this acuteness at all successful in
the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman s allies  for of what
present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that
assures him he is esactly ninetyIthree leagues and a buarter from his
portn bnferable from these statements, are many collateral subtile
matters touching the chase of whalesb

rnd otubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crewb Ihe frencies
of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine
worked anewb uhatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might
have felt before  these were not only now kept out of sight through the
growing awe of rhab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,
as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bisonb Ihe hand
of rate had snatched all their souls  and by the stirring perils of
the previous day  the rack of the past night s suspense  the fised,
unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging
towards its flying mark  by all these things, their hearts were bowled
alongb Ihe wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the
vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible  this seemed the symbol of
that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the raceb

Ihey were one man, not thirtyb ror as the one ship that held them all 
though it was put together of all contrasting thingsIIoak, and maple,
and pine wood  iron, and pitch, and hempIIyet all these ran into each
other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced and
directed by the long central keel  even so, all the individualities of
the crew, this man s valor, that man s fear  guilt and guiltiness, all
varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that fatal
goal which rhab their one lord and keel did point tob

Ihe rigging livedb Ihe mastIheads, like the tops of tall palms, were
outspreadingly tufted with arms and legsb slinging to a spar with one
hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings  others,
shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking
yards  all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for
their fateb rhs how they still strove through that infinite blueness to
seek out the thing that might destroy thems

 uhy sing ye not out for him, if ye see himn  cried rhab, when, after
the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heardb
 oway me up, men  ye have been deceived  not  oby rick casts one odd eet
that way, and then disappearsb 

bt was even so  in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some
other thing for the whaleIspout, as the event itself soon proved  for
hardly had rhab reached his perch  hardly was the rope belayed to its
pin on deck, when he struck the keyInote to an orchestra, that made the
air vibrate as with the combined discharges of riflesb Ihe triumphant
halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, asIImuch nearer to the ship
than the place of the imaginary eet, less than a mile aheadII oby rick
bodily burst into views ror not by any calm and indolent spoutings  not
by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the uhite
uhale now reveal his vicinity  but by the far more wondrous phenomenon
of breachingb  ising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths,
the operm uhale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of
air, and piling up a mountain of daccling foam, shows his place to the
distance of seven miles and moreb bn those moments, the torn, enraged
waves he shakes off, seem his mane  in some cases, this breaching is his
act of defianceb

 Ihere she breachess there she breachess  was the cry, as in his
immeasurable bravadoes the uhite uhale tossed himself salmonIlike to
 eavenb oo suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved
against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised, for
the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier  and
stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling
intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a valeb

Ihe boatssIIstand bys

shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and

his perchb

rs if to strike a buick terror into them, by this time being the first
assailant himself,  oby rick had turned, and was now coming for the
three crewsb rhab s boat was central  and cheering his men, he told them
he would take the whale headIandIhead,IIthat is, pull straight up to his
forehead,IIa not uncommon thing  for when within a certain limit, such
a course escludes the coming onset from the whale s sidelong visionb
 ut ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three boats were
plain as the ship s three masts to his eye  the uhite uhale churning
himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were, rushing
among the boats with open eaws, and a lashing tail, offered appalling
battle on every side  and heedless of the irons darted at him from every
boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which
those boats were madeb  ut skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling
like trained chargers in the field  the boats for a while eluded him 
though, at times, but by a plank s breadth  while all the time, rhab s
unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shredsb

 ut at last in his untraceable evolutions, the uhite uhale so crossed
and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three
lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,
warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him  though now
for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more
tremendous chargeb oeicing that opportunity, rhab first paid out more
lineI and then was rapidly hauling and eerking in upon it againIIhoping
that way to disencumber it of some snarlsIIwhen losIIa sight more savage
than the embattled teeth of sharkss

saught and twistedIIcorkscrewed in the maces of the line, loose harpoons
and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing
and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of rhab s boatb enly one
thing could be doneb oeicing the boatIknife, he critically reached
withinIIthroughIIand then, withoutIIthe rays of steel  dragged in
the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice
sundering the rope near the chocksIIdropped the intercepted fagot of
steel into the sea  and was all fast againb Ihat instant, the uhite
uhale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines 
by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of otubb and
rlask towards his flukes  dashed them together like two rolling husks on
a surfIbeaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in
a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of
the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly
stirred bowl of punchb

uhile the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after
the revolving lineItubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while
aslope little rlask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his
legs upwards to escape the dreaded eaws of sharks  and otubb was lustily
singing out for some one to ladle him up  and while the old man s
lineIInow partingIIadmitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to
rescue whom he could IIin that wild simultaneousness of a thousand
concreted perils,IIrhab s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards
 eaven by invisible wires,IIas, arrowIlike, shooting perpendicularly
from the sea, the uhite uhale dashed his broad forehead against its
bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air  till it fell
againIIgunwale downwardsIIand rhab and his men struggled out from under
it, like seals from a seaIside caveb

Ihe first uprising momentum of the whaleIImodifying its direction as
he struck the surfaceIIinvoluntarily launched him along it, to a little
distance from the centre of the destruction he had made  and with his
back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from
side to side  and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip
or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and
came sideways smiting the seab  ut soon, as if satisfied that his work
for that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the
ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his
leeward way at a traveller s methodic paceb

rs before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again
came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the
floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and
safely landed them on her decksb oome sprained shoulders, wrists, and
ankles  livid contusions  wrenched harpoons and lances  inestricable
intricacies of rope  shattered oars and planks  all these were there 
but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any oneb rs
with redallah the day before, so rhab was now found grimly clinging to
his boat s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy float  nor
did it so eshaust him as the previous day s mishapb

bn an instant the boat was pulling round close under the sternb

 Ihe sharkss the sharkss  cried a voice from the low cabinIwindow there 
 e master, my master, come backs 

 ut rhab heard nothing  for his own voice was highIlifted then  and the
boat leaped onb

eet the voice spake true  for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when
numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath
the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time they
dipped in the water  and in this way accompanied the boat with their
bitesb bt is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whaleIboats in
those swarming seas  the sharks at times apparently following them in
the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching
regiments in the eastb  ut these were the first sharks that had been
observed by the 
ebuod since the uhite uhale had been first descried 
and whether it was that rhab s crew were all such tigerIyellow
barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the
sharksIIa matter sometimes well known to affect them,IIhowever it was,
they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the othersb

  eart of wrought steels  murmured otarbuck gacing over the side, and
following with his eyes the receding boatII canst thou yet ring boldly

them, openImouthed to the chase  and this the critical third daynIIror

Ihe boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mastIheadsIIa
downward pointed arm, rhab knew that the whale had sounded  but
intending to be near him at the nest rising, he held on his way a little
sideways from the vessel  the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest
silence, as the headIbeat waves hammered and hammered against the
opposing bowb

 rrive, drive in your nails, oh ye wavess to their uttermost heads
drive them ins ye but strike a thing without a lid  and no coffin and no
hearse can be mineIIIand hemp only can kill mes  as has 

ouddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles  then
buickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of
ice, swiftly rising to the surfaceb r low rumbling sound was heard  a
subterraneous hum  and then all held their breaths  as bedraggled with
trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise,
but oblibuely from the seab ohrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it
hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air  and then fell swamping back
into the deepb srushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for
an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of
flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the
marble trunk of the whaleb

  ive ways  cried rhab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to
the attack  but maddened by yesterday s fresh irons that corroded in
him,  oby rick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell
from heavenb Ihe wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad
white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together 
as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats  and once more
flailed them apart  spilling out the irons and lances from the two
mates  boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows,
but leaving rhab s almost without a scarb

uhile raggoo and eueebueg were stopping the strained planks  and as the
whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he
shot by them again  at that moment a buick cry went upb rashed round
and round to the fish s back  pinioned in the turns upon turns in which,
during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines
around him, the half torn body of the 
arsee was seen  his sable raiment
frayed to shreds  his distended eyes turned full upon old rhabb

Ihe harpoon dropped from his handb

  efooled, befooleds IIdrawing in a long lean breathII rye, 
arsees b
see thee againbIIrye, and thou goest before  and this, I bo then is the
hearse that thou didst promiseb  ut b hold thee to the last letter of
thy wordb uhere is the second hearsen rway, mates, to the ships those
boats are useless now  repair them if ye can in time, and return to
me  if not, rhab is enough to dieIIrown, mens the first thing that but
offers to eump from this boat b stand in, that thing b harpoonb ee are
not other men, but my arms and my legs  and so obey mebIIuhere s the
whalen gone down againn 

 ut he looked too nigh the boat  for as if bent upon escaping with the
corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had
been but a stage in his leeward voyage,  oby rick was now again steadily
swimming forward  and had almost passed the ship,IIwhich thus far had
been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the present
her headway had been stoppedb  e seemed swimming with his utmost
velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the
seab

 ehs rhab,  cried otarbuck,  not too late is it, even now, the third
day, to desistb oees  oby rick seeks thee notb bt is thou, thou, that
madly seekest hims 

oetting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to
leeward, by both oars and canvasb rnd at last when rhab was sliding
by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish otarbuck s face as he
leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and follow
him, not too swiftly, at a eudicious intervalb  lancing upwards, he
saw Iashtego, eueebueg, and raggoo, eagerly mounting to the three
mastIheads  while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats
which had but eust been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in
repairing themb ene after the other, through the portIholes, as he sped,
he also caught flying glimpses of otubb and rlask, busying themselves
on deck among bundles of new irons and lancesb rs he saw all this  as he
heard the hammers in the broken boats  far other hammers seemed driving
a nail into his heartb  ut he ralliedb rnd now marking that the vane or
flag was gone from the mainImastIhead, he shouted to Iashtego, who had
eust gained that perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer
and nails, and so nail it to the mastb

uhether fagged by the three days  running chase, and the resistance
to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore  or whether it was some
latent deceitfulness and malice in himI whichever was true, the uhite
uhale s way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly
nearing him once more  though indeed the whale s last start had not been
so long a one as beforeb rnd still as rhab glided over the waves the
unpitying sharks accompanied him  and so pertinaciously stuck to the
boat  and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades became
eagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at almost
every dipb

  eed them nots those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oarsb 
ull ons
 tis the better rest, the shark s eaw than the yielding waterb 

  ut at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smallers 

 Ihey will last long enoughs pull onsII ut who can tell IIhe
mutteredII whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on
rhabnII ut pull ons rye, all alive, nowIIwe near himb Ihe helms take the
helms let me pass, IIand so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward
to the bows of the still flying boatb

rt length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along
with the uhite uhale s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its
advanceIIas the whale sometimes willIIand rhab was fairly within the
smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale s spout, curled
round his great,  onadnock hump  he was even thus close to him  when,
with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise highIlifted to the
poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the
hated whaleb rs both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked
into a morass,  oby rick sideways writhed  spasmodically rolled his nigh
flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly
canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated part of the
gunwale to which he then clung, rhab would once more have been tossed
into the seab rs it was, three of the oarsmenIIwho foreknew not the
precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for its
effectsIIthese were flung out  but so fell, that, in an instant two of
them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a combing
wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again  the third man helplessly
dropping astern, but still afloat and swimmingb

rlmost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,
instantaneous swiftness, the uhite uhale darted through the weltering
seab  ut when rhab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with
the line, and hold it so  and commanded the crew to turn round on their
seats, and tow the boat up to the mark  the moment the treacherous line
felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty airs

 uhat breaks in men oome sinew crackssII tis whole again  oarss oarss
 urst in upon hims 

 earing the tremendous rush of the seaIcrashing boat, the whale wheeled
round to present his blank forehead at bay  but in that evolution,
catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship  seemingly seeing
in it the source of all his persecutions  bethinking itIIit may beIIa
larger and nobler foe  of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing
prow, smiting his eaws amid fiery showers of foamb

rhab staggered  his hand smote his foreheadb  b grow blind  handss

 Ihe whales Ihe ships  cried the cringing oarsmenb

 earss oarss olope downwards to thy depths, e sea, that ere it be for
ever too late, rhab may slide this last, last time upon his marks b seeI
the ships the ships rash on, my mens uill ye not save my shipn 

 ut as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the
sledgeIhammering seas, the before whaleIsmitten bowIends of two planks
burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat
lay nearly level with the waves  its halfIwading, splashing crew, trying
hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring waterb

 eantime, for that one beholding instant, Iashtego s mastIhead hammer
remained suspended in his hand  and the red flag, halfIwrapping him as
with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own
forwardIflowing heart  while otarbuck and otubb, standing upon the
bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the downIcoming monster eust as soon
as heb

now come to her, for the voyage is upb 

rrom the ship s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive  hammers,
bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their
hands, eust as they had darted from their various employments  all their
enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side strangely
vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of overspreading
semicircular foam before him as he rushedb  etribution, swift vengeance,
eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal
man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship s
starboard bow, till men and timbers reeledb oome fell flat upon their
facesb rike dislodged trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook
on their bullIlike necksb Ihrough the breach, they heard the waters
pour, as mountain torrents down a flumeb

 Ihe ships Ihe hearsesIIthe second hearses  cried rhab from the boat 
 its wood could only be rmericans 

riving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran buivering along its
keel  but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far
off the other bow, but within a few yards of rhab s boat, where, for a
time, he lay buiescentb

 b turn my body from the sunb uhat ho, Iashtegos let me hear thy hammerb

and all hearses to one common pools and since neither can be mine, let
me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee,
thou damned whales I bo, b give up the spears 

Ihe harpoon was darted  the stricken whale flew forward  with igniting
velocity the line ran through the grooves IIran foulb rhab stooped to
clear it  he did clear it  but the flying turn caught him round the
neck, and voicelessly as Iurkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was
shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was goneb sest instant, the
heavy eyeIsplice in the rope s final end flew out of the starkIempty
tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its
depthsb

ror an instant, the tranced boat s crew stood still  then turnedb  Ihe
shipn  reat  od, where is the shipn  ooon they through dim, bewildering
mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous rata  organa 
only the uppermost masts out of water  while fised by infatuation, or
fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the pagan harpooneers
still maintained their sinking lookouts on the seab rnd now, concentric
circles seiced the lone boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating
oar, and every lanceIpole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all
round and round in one vortes, carried the smallest chip of the 
ebuod
out of sightb

 ut as the last whelmings intermisingly poured themselves over the
sunken head of the bndian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the
erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag,
which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying
billows they almost touched IIat that instant, a red arm and a hammer
hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing
the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding sparb r skyIhawk that
tauntingly had followed the mainItruck downwards from its natural home
among the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding Iashtego there 
this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the
hammer and the wood  and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill,
the submerged savage beneath, in his deathIgasp, kept his hammer frocen
there  and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his
imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive form folded in the
flag of rhab, went down with his ship, which, like oatan, would not sink
to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her, and
helmeted herself with itb

sow small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf  a sullen white
surf beat against its steep sides  then all collapsed, and the great
shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years agob
